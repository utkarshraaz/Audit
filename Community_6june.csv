The session was very nice and I was planning to start paper money trading and you helped me do it. Thank you:)
I tried to explore the Tradingview platform. What I noticed is it doesn't limit my capital money instead limit my profit money which actually allows me to buy how much shares I want.  using this when I was facing loss, I bought a large number of shares at a low price to adjust my average which later on I sold on the whole and like this, I booked the profit of 60000000$ which is not at all possible in the practical world. 😦

Jargon: Common Stock

A share of COMMON STOCK is a single share of ownership in a corporation available for purchase on most trading platforms. If a company has 500 shares in total, then owning five shares would make you a 1% owner of the company.

KEY ADVANTAGES:
1. Ownership in a company so you can brag that you are part owner in Tesla.
2. Voting rights! You can tell your friends: “Well maybe that’s how Elon feels but I’m going to have a word with him. Technically, I’m his boss!”
3. Eligible for dividend payouts. Mr. Wonderful’s momma always told him to hold dividend-yielding stocks.

Common stock is indeed a tangible asset as discussed yesterday.",null,🤩 (5),productivity,null,5,666,2021-10-30

Jargon: Preferred Stock

A share of STOCK in a corporation that comes with no voting rights but has a preference in terms of dividend payments and liquidation.

KEY ADVANTAGES:
1. Dividends get paid out first (versus common). Dividend payouts are also calculated differently than common stock but this is a topic for a different time.
2. If a company goes bankrupt, chances are common shareholders will get nothing. Preferred holders get priority (but bond-holders come first).
3. Preferred shares are CALLABLE. We’ll cover this later.

DISADVANTAGES:
1. No voting rights.
2. There is interest rate risk (we’ll cover this later too) on preferred stock, due to how the dividends are paid out.",null,"❤️ (2),👀 (1)",productivity,null,3,699,2021-10-31

Jargon: Dividend


A dividend is the distribution of some of a company’s earnings to its shareholders, as determined by the company’s board of directors.

1. Some people like div-paying stocks since you’ll actually see a return on your investment, whereas non-div-paying stocks are a guess whether the stock prices will go up or down.

2. Dividends are usually paid out as cash but may also be paid out as stock.
3. There is a date called the “ex-div date”. As long as you own the dividend prior to that date, you’ll receive dividends at the payout date.
4. Preferred stock dividends are calculated differently than common stock dividends.


MORE BRAIN FOOD:
When a company announces an upcoming div payment the “good news” will cause the stock price to rise. When the dividend is paid out, the shares will drop a bit since the div payment is coming off the company’s balance sheet.

There is a type of trading called “div trading” which is dedicated to this (we will cover when we get to trading strategies).

Bid: The amount of money a buyer is willing to pay for each share of a given stock.

Ask The amount of money the seller is willing to accept for each share of a given stock.

Bid-Ask-Spread: The difference between the two.
 
Following up from Yesterday's Jargon: Stocks with very narrow spreads are quite LIQUID while stocks with very wide spreads are ILLIQUID.

Can you see why?
 
Example of BID/ASK: ITC is being quoted at Rs.100/Rs.101
The buyer will pay the ASK price of Rs.101.
The seller will receive the BID price of Rs.100.

Jargon: Long vs Short

“Long” or “being long” means you are bullish about a stock so you buy shares and hold them for a period of time, anticipating that the stock will rise in value and you will be able to sell your shares later for a profit.

What if you anticipate a stock will FALL in value? How can you profit off that?

Here is how you SHORT a stock:
1. Pick a stock you believe will fall in value.
2. Borrow the stock from an entity (usually you will pay a small fee for doing this).
3. Sell the stock to a 3rd party.
4. Wait until the stock falls.
5. Buy the stock back.
6. Return it back to the entity you borrowed it from.


Overly simplified example:
1. AAPL is currently trading at $100. Bob believes AAPL will drop in price.
2. Bob goes out and borrows 10 shares from JPMorgan (let’s assume no fee for this example).
3. Bob sells those 10 shares on the stock market for a total of $1,000.
4. AAPL falls a week later to $50 per share.
5. Bob buys 10 shares on the market for $500.
6. Bob returns the 10 shares to JPMorgan, and pockets the extra $500.",null,💯 (2),productivity,null,2,1070,2021-11-07

Jargon: IPO

An IPO or Initial Public Offering is the first sale or offering of a stock by a company to the public. An IPO occurs when a company decides to go public rather than remain solely owned by private or inside investors.

Why go public?

1. Allows the company to raise capital from public investors
2. Early investors, executives, and in some cases many employees get to
“cash in” on the shares of the company that they have been holding
3. Liquidity for investors is increased

Some More Tidbits:

Usually, at least one large investment bank is nominated as an underwriter
to bring the company public. It’s a pretty big honor (and paycheck) so there is
a lot of negotiating before the lead underwriter is selected
Going public means your company is going to be under SEC scrutiny going

Jargon: Stock Exchange

A stock exchange is a location where stockbrokers and traders can buy and sell shares in a company. 

These companies are PUBLIC as discussed yesterday, so trading happening behind closed doors wouldn’t be very fair to other potential investors.

The five largest stock exchanges in the world are:

1. New York Stock Exchange:  $28 Trillion
2. Nasdaq:           $13 Trillion
3. Japan Stock Exchange:    $5 Trillion
4. Shanghai Stock Exchange:  $5 Trillion
5. Hong Kong Stock Exchange: $4 Trillion

There are exchanges that trade other securities as well, but for today we are discussing just stock exchanges.

Some cool facts:

Exchanges used to be in physical locations. Ever seen those epic videos of people shouting at each other in a crowded room holding sheets of paper? Those were physical exchanges.
Now, trading is ALMOST all done electronically (Nasdaq was the first electronic exchange!).
If a stock on the NYSE has an average 30-day trading price of below $1, it gets delisted from the exchange!",null,null,productivity,null,0,1038,2021-11-10

Jargon: Pink Sheets

Pink sheets are stocks that are not listed on any public stock exchanges, they trade over-the-counter.

Pink sheets are sometimes referred to as “penny stocks” because they are so cheap, usually due to the small market capsize of the company.

Depending on the exchange requirements, usually, pink sheets are not listed on an exchange because their price per share is simply too low, most often less than $3-$4.

Since there is very little regulation on pink sheets, they are very risky, but due to their volatile nature, it is possible for some PS stocks to see incredible growth in a short period of time. There are firms that have capitalized on this.

Most brokerage-related movies often show scenes of brokers trying to push PS stocks to uneducated investors, claiming that due to the low prices the upside is incredible (meanwhile the brokers make a killing on fees).

Penny stocks are called “pink sheets” because the listings were originally printed on pink paper. Now they are published electronically but are still listed as “OTC PINK”.",null,🔥 (1),productivity,null,1,1075,2021-11-11

Jargon: Volatility

Google Definition: Volatility is the liability to change rapidly and unpredictably, especially for the worse.

Investopedia Definition: In finance, volatility is the degree of variation of a trading price series over time, usually measured by the standard deviation of logarithmic returns.

Volatility is usually measured using standard deviation, which indicates how tightly the price of a stock is clustered around the mean.

Simply put, volatility is how “jumpy” a stock is. If a stock is slow to move either up or down it’s not very volatile.

The statistics behind volatility, how it’s calculated, and how it helps technical traders are pretty vast and we will certainly not go into that here, but it is one of the most exciting measures of stock for quant traders. 

We’ll be covering much more jargon that has the word “volatile” not too far in the future.

Jargon: Sector

A sector is an industry or market that shares common operating characteristics.

“Technology” is a sector.

“Health Care” is a sector.

Often you’ll find that stocks within a sector have related stock price movements.

For example, say there was an alien invasion and these aliens ate METAL for food. They started eating all the metal on Earth.

The automobile sector would likely see a significant drop in value.

In other words, most automobile stocks (Nissan, Toyota, Tesla, etc.) would see their stock price DROP significantly.

Traders would imagine that because metal is now so rare, car manufacturers will have to charge a lot more for each vehicle, which will in turn cause fewer cars to be sold.

This is bad for the car companies and their stock price would drop as a result.

Fun Fact:
Is TSLA an automobile company? For years many banks just weren’t sure. Some had TSLA as an Auto company while other banks had TSLA as a Tech stock. TSLA has even dabbled in the Energy sector!

Jargon: Global Industry Classification Standard

“GICS” or Global Industry Classification Standard is an industry taxonomy developed in 1999 by MSCI and S&P for use by the global financial community. GICS consists of 11 sectors, 24 industry groups, 69 industries, and 158 sub-industries.

(Thank you very much Wiki dear)

Ok, so what did all that fancy talk mean?

We discussed SECTOR yesterday. But what if Goldman calls it “Autos” and Morgan Stanley calls it “Cars”. What if Goldman has a second level breakdown under Autos called “Gas, Electric, and Self-Sustaining” while Morgan only has “Powered, and Self-Sustaining” 

Having each firm decide all levels of sector classifications can get messy very quickly, and it makes it near impossible to share data between firms.

Let’s say Citi hires DTCC to clean their trades, but DTCC returns the trades with their OWN sector classifications which don’t fit into the Citi system?

Enter GICS.

It’s universal; nearly everyone in finance is on GICS already.

FUN FACT:
When GICS decides to update their sectors it costs firms in some cases MILLIONS of dollars to do testing and updates to all of their systems and data.

Jargon: Volume & Average Daily Traded Volume

Volume is a count of how many shares of stock have traded during a trading period.

When talking raw volume, usually it just means how much was traded over the course of a day.

ADTV is “Average Daily Traded Volume” which is a popular metric used to see how liquid a stock has been trading over a time period.

Let’s take the most popular version of ADTV:
“ADTV22” AKA “The one-month average daily trading volume”.

Let’s pretend we have a fairly illiquid stock called QZT.

If QZT traded 100 shares each day for 21 days, and then for the last day it traded 50,000 shares, what would the ADTV22 be?

((100 * 21) + (50000 * 1)) / 22 = 2,368 shares a day on average.

You can see the weakness for doing this for illiquid stocks such as this unusual case. It doesn’t tell the full story; this stock looks quite liquid but really it just had one great day!

For your average liquid stock, this metric works just fine.",null,🙌 (2),productivity,null,2,967,2021-11-15

Jargon: Index

An index is a method by which to measure the performance of a group of assets. Some indices are very broad such as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones, while others are much narrower such as the S&P GSCI Energy & Metals index.

You can think of an index as a basket of securities that helps you understand how a certain sector is performing.

Most people use an index to help them track how their investment is doing “relative to an index”.

For example, if you are pretty sure that Honda is doing a great job at manufacturing new vehicles so you invest heavily, you might want to track your investment versus an auto index to see how your pick stacks up against autos in general.

Not only do indices track sectors, but there are even country-based indices!

Another great use for indices is diverse investing. If you only have a couple of thousand dollars to invest, it might be tricky to diversify your portfolio. Buying into funds that track popular diverse indices (such as the S&P or DJ), could be a great way to diversify at a low cost.",null,💯 (1),productivity,null,1,1059,2021-11-16

Jargon: ETF

An Exchange Traded Fund (ETF), is a security that is comprised of a basket of securities built to track an index, sector, commodity, bonds, or any asset
quite frankly. ETFs can be bought and sold on a stock exchange just like the underlying securities!

Big banks often construct ETFs to follow certain investment strategies (not even a specific index or sector in particular), and offer them to their PB
clients to invest in.


One of the most popular ETFs is the SPDR S&P 500 ETF which trades by the ticker SPY. This tracks the S&P 500.

ETF popularity has skyrocketed in the past two decades. In 2003, worldwide ETF assets equaled $204Bn. By 2020 that number had reached $7.7Tr !!

Did you know?
People love buying ETFs because to get the same level of diversification, you would have to buy all of the underlying components individually which aside from being quite cumbersome and expensive also costs quite a lot on brokerage commissions.

8.16297E+17,Srishti#0907,2021-11-20 01:59:00,"Hi Keshav
That's quite a question! From what I understand, feelings direct our thoughts. We are constantly driven to find an explanation to what we see or feel and that's where thoughts come into the picture. 

For example, a person performing on stage gets jitters backstage. A confident person would be feeling good so he will call it excitement. But a person who's not confident would be feeling negative so he might call it nervousness. And then our thoughts spiral down.

If you want to read further this might help: https://www.futurelearn.com/info/blog/thinking-and-feeling-whats-the-difference 

Also programming your subconscious is like building muscle memory, you can remind yourself to think in a certain way - how does benefit me, how can I overcome this challenge - and soon that is how your mindset will become.

So I just finished consulting exploration. The best thing I like about consultants is their way of thinking and approaching problems. The way they structure problems fascinates me. A problem can be a result of a variety of factors and handpicking  it from a ocean of problems is not gonna land you anywhere, structured thinking is what gets you to the root of the problem. The way consultants understand businesses in short span of time and limited resoucres makes me curious towards this career.

So getting data from the client is one of the most important parts of solving a problem. Typically, you'll get a whole dump of data from the client and there will be too much noise to directly go ahead with your analysis. You'll need to narrow it down yourself and identify the useful parts. The backoffices do less problem solving compared to the consultants, they usually support with things such as visualising data. The backoffices can also assist with background research, competitor analysis etc. But direct client interactions, getting data, etc. are part of your day-to-day work.

**UX Writing:** The idea of writing the microcopy is quite impressive. The keywords and action verbs being used are prompting and overarching too. 

**Visual Design:** The typography, color scheme and iconography can be enhanced. Hence, another iteration can be made with better UI elements. Following are the few suggestions which you might consider:
1. Visual hierarchy needs to be taken care of.  As a result, visual balance is disturbed.
2. The font formatting can be enhanced by using more vibrant and varied colors. The font size of the quote is too small to read effortlessly.
3. The first impression of users is being drawn towards the background, which is also not in coherent with the birthday theme. The major focus should have been on the birthday invitation information to be conveyed. 
4. The design is less intuitive as icons are missing for crucial pieces of information, such as day, time, and address.

1. Why two exclamations? Doesn't one exclamation communicate it properly?

2. Jokes need to be very thought through if you want to include them. Why would parents like this joke? Do they not send their kids out to play? Are you saying they're making their kids full if they're not sending them to this birthday party? As a rule of thumb, remove things until you can't prove their importance otherwise. Follow minimalism when writing content.

3. White text on light background means low contrast and thus illegible text. Try giving the text some shadow so that it appears more prominent and distinctly readable.

4. This is not a Harry Potter themed card. Then why the Harry Potter address? Again, put only those things which seem absolutely necessary. Otherwise remove them.

Goal 2 - Once you have identified all the steps, its time to perform detailed analysis of each step to figure out all the probable actions that a user might take.

Goal 3 - Now, piece all steps together to create an overall user flow ( consider all possibilities ). The aim is to draw the user journey flow chart.

Jargon: Arbitrage

Arbitrage is an opportunity to make free money by taking advantage of a price discrepancy for the same asset.

A really simple example would be if XYZ stock sold on both NASDAQ and NYSE. On NASDAQ the stock was trading for $99 a share and on NYSE, $100 per share.

You could buy 100 shares on NASDAQ for $9,900 and instantly flip the shares on NYSE for $10,000 making $100 profit completely risk-free.

This is known as Pure Arbitrage.

Risk Arbitrage is similar, but it’s with a bit of a gamble included so you could potentially be wrong and end up losing.

Arbitrage used to exist but in practice it is VERY difficult for regular retail investors to take advantage of these opportunities nowadays since market makers have powerful algos seeking and taking advantage of these the moment they exist, closing the gap instantly.

Arbitrage isn’t just about stocks, it could also work across multiple assets.

For example, you could purchase an asset in one country and sell it in another where there is a mismatch in currency exchange rates.",null,👍 (1),productivity,null,1,1066,2021-12-01

Jargon: Asset Class

We already discussed “asset” (our first jargon). There are tangible and intangible assets.

We defined stocks (common and preferred), but there are many other assets.

The official online definition of the asset class is:

“An asset class is a grouping of investments that exhibit similar characteristics and are subject to the same laws and regulations.”

Each “type” of asset is in a class of its own, hence “asset class”.

Stocks are part of the EQUITY asset class.

This is because when you own a stock you own equity in a company.

Jargon: Cash and Cash Equivalent

The important thing to know about this asset class is that it is the most liquid of all asset classes.

From a regulatory perspective, this is an extremely important asset class for big banks as they might need some extra cash on hand quickly if some of their more risky trades turn sour.

Often this asset class is also turned to when a party needs to post collateral.

So what can be liquidated quickly?

> Cash
> Govt Bonds
> Commercial Paper

From an accounting perspective, cash and cash equivalents help companies with their working capital needs since these liquid assets are used to pay off current liabilities, which are short-term debts and bills.

You’re generally not expecting amazing returns from this asset class. Unlike other asset classes, its purpose is those mentioned above, not to earn profits.

One of my friend told me that he has made a demat account and has began purchasing stocks, that ignited  curiosity inside me. I used to send him money and we purchased stocks over news and emotions(made some profits though,market recover krrha tha to jo khreeda profit hogya lol) then I started reading and watching videos regarding stock market, things started making sense. I religiously followed akshat shrivastava(an Insead Alum) ,read finshots & the ken  for almost 1.5 year. I studied nothing but finanance, learned basic concepts of economics, fundamental analysis and technical analysis. Made my own demat account and made a lot of trades to get my hands dirty along with learning new concepts day by day.
The best thing I liked about stock market is I can connect it with humans, there is a lot of similarity between stocks and humans. On the other hand,As a retail investor I hate lack of information and inabilty to judge management of a company, you can't manage to know what's going inside a management of a company.

create.Made some pretty profits too by following the trading strategies. Trading in derivatives is an equational game, means if you win someone else loose.

Jargon: Alternative Investments

We already covered the major asset classes: Equity, Fixed Income, Cash, or Cash Equivalent.

There are quite a few additional asset classes but most institutions don’t agree on how to categorize them.

Some institutions put them all in a catch-all bucket called “Alternative Investments”, while some institutions categorize them individually.

Since I would like to move on to new topics I’m going to bucket them here as well.

Here are a few asset classes that might fall in the alternative bucket or might stand on their own:

1. Real Estate – Land & Property
2. Commodities – Gold, Minerals, Oil, Grains, Beef, etc.
3. Cryptocurrency – Bitcoin, ETH, Dogecoin, Potcoin, etc.
4. Art – Paintings, sculptors, etc.
5. Private Equity
…and more

Most analytic-driven firms won’t bucket all of these into one “Alternatives” bucket because commodities are affected by seasonality while art is not. Bucketing like this isn’t very safe for making assumptions about investments or risks given how different these asset classes are.

Another example: Real estate is a very stable investment. Crypto is more erratic than Goofy on drugs.",null,👍 (1),productivity,null,1,1166,2021-12-05

Jargon: Bonds

A bond is a fixed income instrument. It’s a loan made by YOU the “bondholder” to a corporation or government “the issuer” to help them raise money for use in their company or government. This is paid back either slowly over time or as a lump sum, often many years later.

***Storytime***

Zapple Computing is excited to release its latest offering the iBalloon, a balloon that streams both party streamers AND music! Sadly, they have run out of funds for manufacturing. Already pretty diluted, they don’t want to offer up any more equity of the company (stock issuance) to raise capital, so instead, they offer YOU, Jane Doe, a BOND in exchange for a gazillion dollars.

They then use the gazillion dollars and invest it all in their iBalloon product which is a colossal failure.

The company goes bankrupt and you never see a penny back on your gazillion dollar investment.

Meaning - a person who has a passion for food
Context - I came across this word while reading about the difference between 'pleasure' and 'enjoyment' in the book 'Flow'. The author explained that enjoying an activity or task requires skill and extreme focus whereas this isn't so for pleasure. He gives an example that everybody takes pleasure in eating food. But a gourmet enjoys food by paying attention to the extent that she can discriminate the different sensations provided by it.

Jargon: Zero Coupon Bond

As discussed above, a bond is a loan from you (the bondholder) to an entity that gets paid back to you at some point in the future.

The simplest bond to understand both conceptually and mathematically is the zero-coupon bond.

It’s simply a loan paid back in the future at a higher amount.

There are no intermediate interest payments.

Example: A $1,000 bond that expires in one year is trading for $900 today.

Essentially it’s as if you invested your $900 and earned 11% interest over the year, a very nice return on investment.

There is a pretty substantial risk to consider though. What if this bond pays out not in 1 but in 10 years.

You won’t see a penny until the expiration date, which is a long time to “hope” that the company or gov’t doesn’t go bankrupt! If they do go under, there is a chance you won’t see your money.


Fun Fact!
You DO have to pay taxes (federal, state, and local), on the money you earn on the bond (in this case a total of $100). In some cases, you’ll have to pay taxes on the interest that you have earned throughout the bond period EVEN THOUGH YOU DIDN’T GET A PAYOUT YET.

Pretty weird.

There are ways around this but we won’t get into this today.",null,null,productivity,null,0,1222,2021-12-08

8.11144E+17,Explorin#4311,2021-12-10 21:11:00,"Reading Day 3 done

Principal insight: Read a chapter on types of thinking devised by Chanakya. Following are the various ways of thinking I came across today:

1. Both-Side thinking: Considering pros and cons, i.e. both sides of the coin in every situation. 

2. Alternative thinking: Choosing one way of thinking from Sama, Dana, Bheda, Danda based on the person or situation you are dealing with

3. Leadership Thinking: driven by the laws of selflessness, such a thought process is unleashed only in Kings, whose true source of happiness lies in the happiness of his people. It is an all-inclusive thinking which encompasses the living and non-living, 
such as animals, birds, plants, minerals, water and all else parts of the kingdom.

4. Creative thinking: He says creativity is perfectly executed when decisions taken are based on right time and right timing.

5. Lateral thinking: Thinking out of box, while ensuring the existence of the box. Sometimes we get trapped in our own illusions.

6. Spiritual Thinking: Highest form of thinking, which means to be in tune with the laws of nature through a state of awareness. While practising this thinking, you follow the path of dharma. Dharma denotes various ideas and concepts - morality, ethics, duty, responsibility and spirituality 

Learning: To do spiritual good while enjoying the wordly and creating material well-being requires a balance in your thinking, which greatly comes through Meditation. As described in this book, Meditation is the process of controlling flow of thoughts and calming the mind.",null,"🔥 (3),💯 (3)",reading,null,6,1566,2021-12-10

Suggestions from my side are:
1. The first steps in solving a Product problem is defining the objective( the metric which we want to move) and understanding the users.  I thought that you didn't define these concretely

Understanding the users: you only listed that they are 1st/2nd year students. Try to be more exhaustive about who they are, what are their motivations, problems,.. Here, here you are free to create multiple user personas.

Objective: ""improving the user experience"" is an abstract objective, try to define your objective as something which is concrete and can be measured. for eg: acquisition, engagement( time spent on the platform+ discord), course completion rate,..

2. List the problems that the users face before thinking about the improvements.

This would make you think more exhaustively about problems. Otherwise directly jumping to the improvements makes you biased and you might miss some problems which they face.

3. Loved how you hypothesized and validated improvements 3 and 4. The only problem was that you gave solutions for improvements 1 and 2 beforehand, so the structure went for a toss. First validate all the problems and then give solutions together.
4. Give the reasons why you assumed one improvement to be more impactful/effort than the other. I know it's the hard part but giving proper reasoning would enhance your clarity of the goal you decided in the first step.",null,"🔥 (3),♥️ (1)",finance,null,4,1509,2021-12-11

@Keshav Bidawatka gave a lot of to-the-point feedbacks.

Here are a few feedbacks from my side.
1. The most important point, everyone might know the solution, the catch is how well can you present it. Also, don't assume anything that the person reading/evaluating might know.
Structure your thoughts, and structure your presentation.
A few more things you should have covered:
1. Who are the users?: Mentioning the users is fine, but who are they. You shouldn't assume that anyone reading knows the traits. Explain them better to set the expectation about your target user base so that they follow you across the submission easily.

2. Add a why for everything. If you are proposing something, add WHY for every proposed recommendation.

3. Cover metrics of measurement, and how will you define is your recommendation ends up being a success, or becomes a failure.

Remember, these are suggestions, and you might have a different perspective. If so, would love to discuss and hear you out.",null,null,finance,null,0,1017,2021-12-12

Insights:
Might talk basically about the tone of his books.
I love this writer's style. Building up tension, accurate and detailed narrations and bold sentences that annihilate all the tension/suspense he has made up till then. Such a down-to-earth writer in-person and the same reflects in his books. Has Economics majors, so we can see the expertise spilled into his books when he talks deeply about politics and kingdoms' macro-economic scenarios. Richly fabricated culture and scenes.

Context: Was reading a blog on ed-tech startups which deploy Income Sharing Agreement(ISA).

I'm not a designer nor a front-end specialist
But I'll tell what I think

things I liked:
table:
- good background choice
- proportions of logo and table seems proper enough
- adding border radius is a good choice in modern design terms since it gives a natural look
form:
- I think you went for  sweet large black buttons with white text fields, that'd look sweet

can add finishing:
- top margin could've been added
table: 
- width of the table spanning the complete page seems a bit off. Usually people want to move their eyes only a bit. 
- modern designs are usually a bit 'flat' looking rather than 3-d looking; slim borders and no/soft shadows will avoid giving it a 3-d look
-  Probably, black border on an orange button isn't the best choice; such details add up to give things unprofessional look
- margin between two columns can either be completely eliminated or increased a bit. Looks bit off, personally. 
-small but bold texts get hard to read on low-res screens
form:
- width vs height ratio could've been more natural, I think
- left aligned placeholder texts would give your form a look that it's narrower
- again, padding between the Submit button and last field would be great",null,"❤️ (4),💯 (2)",software-development,null,6,1230,2021-12-28

BOOK: Thinking fast and slow.
Some common things which can be the reason of your perfectness. Change the way to think. For example **it is much easier, as well as far more enjoyable, to identify and label the mistakes of others than to recognize our own. Questioning what we believe and want is difficult at the best of times, and especially difficult when we most need to do it, but we can benefit from the informed opinions of others. Many of us spontaneously anticipate how friends and colleagues will evaluate our choices; the quality and content of these anticipated judgments therefore matters. The expectation of intelligent gossip is a powerful motive for serious self-criticism, more powerful than New Year resolutions to improve one’s decision making at work and at home **",null,💯 (2),reading,null,2,794,2022-01-05

""The world is moving very fast. We are always surrounded by electronic devices which crave for our attention. We are trying to engage ourselves or do something every second of the waking hour.

Bamboozled as to where I am leading?

It is that digital noises have infiltrated our normal every day conversations with people around us. 

Haven't you been frustrated when someone you are talking to starts surfing his/her phone? Or you are sitting in a room where two of your friends are watching noisy reels.

This destroys the essence of the whole conversation by diminishing our ability to think and have deep conversations, which is a double-edged sword.

So, be in an environment where healthy distraction-less conversations happen. You would feel energized there instead of being drained.""",null,💯 (2),writing,null,2,839,2022-01-07

Reading: A Practical Guide to Quantitative Finance Interviews

Chapter-01: General Principals

5 General Principals that will be extremely useful for Quant Interviews

1) Build a Broad Knowledge Base:
    Usually, quant is classified as a problem solver, so a basic understanding of a 
    broad range of topics often helps in better analyzing problems, so the 
    interviewer expects us to have broad knowledge in Maths, Finance, and 
    Programming
2) Practice your Interview Skills:
     Prepare yourself for potential questions long before you enter an interview 
     room
3) Listen Carefully: 
   It helps us to understand the problem well before we attempt to answer them, 
   Interviewer doesn't expect a complete solution, rather focuses on our approach 
   in solving the problem
4) Speak your Mind:
     Conver your analysis to the interviewer, which indeed creates an opportunity 
     for the interviewer to correct the mistakes in our approach If any
5) Make reasonable assumptions:
     In Quant job, you are unlikely to have all the necessary information or data 
     you'd prefer to have before you build a model or a decision
     So, it is advisable to make reasonable assumptions and design appropriate 
     frameworks to solve problems",null,💜 (1),reading,null,1,1269,2022-01-08

We get so focused on what we think is important that we fail to see the really big stuff  that’s threatening to derail us, whether it’s social media, or  the latest technological advances, or  the rise of the millennials, or whatever. We’re too often focused on the wrong stuff.
Pick your heads up, people. Look around. Notice the new stuff  because there’s an awfully lot of important new stuff out there to notice. Pay attention to it. Study it. Learn it.",null,💯 (1),reading,null,1,631,2022-01-08

Don’t believe me? Here you go:

For quite some days I’m observing how we walk in a group of friends in campus. The group usually divides into a number of dynamic subgroups with some finding themselves walking alone. So the solo ones are constantly in a hunt to find spaces in a subgroup to walk and interact with. This leads to some other guy getting eliminated from the subgroup, who in turn tries to rejoin or join another XD.

This happens on a loop and it becomes an unconscious game of finding horizontal friends from the group to walk and be engaged with.

Let's start with a question.
Tell me below how’s your life going. Are you satisfied and happy?

If not, don’t fret. Everybody faces problems. Anger, frustration, anxiety, and all the other emotions which arise with problems are a part and byproduct of life.

And if you think that the problems or negative emotions which you are going through are only plaguing you, then you are wrong. Firstly, people around you might not be sharing that problem openly. Secondly, even if people around you aren’t facing that problem, there’s a larger world out there flooded with people you don’t know.

So, treat your problem as a community problem. Fuel your motivation to solve the problem by solving it for you as well as others. Talk to your mentors about it and dig into the depths of the problem.

After eating, while asking for the bill, the owner pitched trying something like Pizza. This brought water in the mouth of one of my friends.

Seeing the opportunity, the owner started convincing by highlighting the little differential between the old bill amount and the new bill amount after buying a pizza. He even calculated the little amount each one of us would cost with that extra pizza.

So, in the end, we agreed to order it.
Two learnings from the witty owner:

**1. Business instincts:** He caught the opportunity to ramp up the pitch seeing the vulnerability of my friend and came with a convincing argument about how the extra pizza only costs Rs 30 per person.

**2. You gotta show the product to the users: **If you aren’t able to, the quality of your product doesn’t matter. 
The owner knew that students here usually order from Dominos or Pizza Hut. So, this was his chance to show us his pizza. 

Additionally, If we wished to revisit only for waffles, it would be less frequent, but if we liked the pizza, we were more likely to visit again and more frequently.",null,💯 (2),writing,null,2,1179,2022-01-12

Think And Grow Rich(ch-8 , decision)

Insight-
It's better to arrive at a decision quickly and then change it slowly, rather than taking a lot of time to make decisions and then quickly changing it, if influenced by someone. This doesn't mean that we can make decisions abruptly without thinking.

Here are some suggestions that can be looked upon as per UI:
1. As suggested earlier always try using pngs for logo so that they go with the background color. 
2. Try positioning the form labels and input boxes in a well defined manner.(the form seems very irregular) 
3. The text inside input boxes can also be aligned to the left. 
4. The placement of back button at the left looks perfect but you can try not to keep it very far from the form.
5. The space between the input boxes can be decreased.
6. Button size to font size ratio can also be looked upon.",null,null,software-development,null,0,693,2022-01-12

Its based on the idea of weekly reviews on onself. Basically a granular self introspection spanned over weeks. I'd suggest that you create a table (excel preferably) and try to answer these three questions by the end of every week( say  sunday afternoon). 
1. What went well last week?
2. What didn't go well?
3. What changes do I need make to make this week better?

You'll find yourself thinking quite hard for first few weeks for the changes but it'll b a fun activity. Also when you see this table at the end of every week, seeing how far you've come, your happy moments and things you need to work on will make you quite satisfied about yourself. 

Hope this helps! I've been working on this too!

1.    CONVENTIONS ARE YOUR FRIENDS: 
(a) It is recommended to innovate when we know we have a better idea, but take advantage of conventions when we don’t. This recommendation needs to be kept in mind along with the fact that something creative, innovative and original is generally encouraged.
(b)CLARITY TRUMPS CONSISTENCY: If we can make something significantly clearer by making it slightly inconsistent, choose in favor of clarity.
2.    CREATE EFFECTIVE VISUAL HIERARCHIES:
For grasping information instantly, effective visual hierarchies are essential. It is attained by adding following traits to our design: 
(a) The more important something is, the more prominent it is. (For ex, make important elements bolder, larger, visible)
(b) Things that are related logically are related visually. (For ex, similar things can be grouped together under a heading under same visual style.)
(c) Things are “nested” visually to show what’s part of what.
3.    BREAK UP PAGES INTO CLEARLY DEFINED AREAS:
Dividing the page into clearly defined areas is important because it allows users to decide quickly which areas of the page to focus on and which areas they can safely ignore. 
4.    MAKE IT OBVIOUS WHAT’S CLICKABLE:
Users should not get confused with what’s clickable and what’s not clickable.
5.    KEEP THE NOISE DOWN TO DULL ROAR:
One of the great enemies of easy-to-grasp pages is visual noise. The different kinds of noise are:
(a)SHOUTING: Shouting is the result of a failure to make tough decisions about which elements are really the most important. Use hierarchies to eliminate it.
(b)DISORGANIZATION: It indicates things strewn everywhere. Use of grid to align elements can help.
(c)CLUTTER: It refers too much stuff. Elimination of less important things can work to get rid of excess content.
FORMAT TEXT TO SUPPORT SCANNING:
Use plenty of headings, keep paragraphs short, use bulleted lists, highlight key terms for scan-friendly text.",null,null,writing,null,0,1990,2022-01-12

KRUG’S SECOND LAW OF USABILITY:
It doesn’t matter how many times I have to click, as long as each click is a mindless, unambiguous choice. Users don’t mind a lot of clicks as long as each click is painless and they have continued confidence that they’re on the right track.
SCENT OF INFORMATION:
Links that clearly and unambiguously identify their target give off a strong scent that assures users that clicking them will bring them nearer to their “prey.” 
ANIMAL, VEGETABLE OR MINERAL?
It refers to the idea that as long as you accept the premise that anything that’s not a plant or an animal fall under “mineral,” it requires almost no thought to answer the question correctly.
GO FOR EASY CHOICES:
For instance, making an initial selection takes you to another screen where you see only the relevant questions or information for that selection. 
SOME ASSISTANCE MAY BE REQUIRED IN CASE OF DIFFICULT CHOICES:
When you can’t avoid giving me a difficult choice, you need to go out of your way to give me as much guidance as I need—but no more. Guidance should be brief, timely and unavoidable.",null,"🔥 (3),❤️‍🔥 (1)",writing,null,4,1105,2022-01-12

Think And Grow Rich (ch-9 persistence)
Insight - 
Persistence is the key for success. Even if you have much lesser skills, but the ability to work persistently on your goals, you surely will reach your goals. Thomas A. Edison, who, with less than three months of schooling, became the world's leading inventor and converted PERSISTENCE into the talking machine, the moving picture machine, and the incandescent light, to say nothing of half a hundred other useful inventions.
Some great lines - 

* Be PERSISTENT no matter how slowly you may, at first, have to move. WITH PERSISTENCE WILL COME SUCCESS. 
* Without PERSISTENCE, you will be defeated, even before you start. With PERSISTENCE you will win. 
* The FEAR OF CRITICISM is at the bottom of the destruction of most ideas which never reach the PLANNING and ACTION stage.",null,🔥 (1),reading,null,1,841,2022-01-13

OMIT NEEDLESS WORDS
*KRUG’S THIRD LAW OF USABILITY*
Get rid of half the words on each page, then get rid of half of what’s left. (Removing half of the words without losing its value is actually a realistic goal). VIGOROUS WRITING IS CONCISE. (No unnecessary words, lines/parts) Demerits of not omitting needless words: page becomes daunting, its noise level increases, useful info diminishes)
*SOURCES OF NEEDLESS WORDS*
(a) HAPPY TALKS MUST DIE: Happy talk (ex: introductory text that’s supposed to welcome us to the site and tell us how great it is). It conveys no useful information (content-free) and it focuses on saying how great we are (for becoming sociable). Most Web users eliminate happy talks as much as possible. 
(b) INSTRUCTIONS MUST DIE: No one is going to read instructions—at least not until after repeated attempts at “muddling through” have failed.

Information Architecture:

1. Some information is needed for ensuring safety to the parents. 

2. You may try to rearrange the placement of time, location and date. It seems  The current version is not effortless in terms of consuming information. 

Visual Design:

1. Too many random illustrations...try to design with a minimalistic approach to have a elegant and effortless design. What you actually need is one relevant illustration placed appropriately.

2. Instead of illustrations, you use line icons for important details such as time, date and location. 

3. There is a lot to experiment with the background and typography. 

PS - The idea of a blue bg due to dress code is amazing. Your design thinking can be more amazing by trying different iterations. We expect atleast 5-7 iterations of this poster if you ever wish to explore design further.

Text and Contrast
1)Contrast of ""dress code:blue"" need to be improved.
2)Font size of main text is bigger than usual(harsh's 20th birthday party), decrease the font sizes and make the poster spacious.
3)Font type of date, time and location is not very soothing.

I agree with @RAM. You need to follow minimalistic approach.
 1) Background is really complicated with lots of colors and also the upper white box is not soothing on it.
2) Those little light pinks triangles and Lots of differnt illustrations are distracting.

My self Sandeep Kumar ug 2nd student of iit roorkee in branch applied mathematics.
I joined explorin on 31 dec 2021 just after talking with ram sir .
And day after joining the explorin the year and my confidence level both changed .
I am dedicated about my goals and exicted about the next .
I had completed my first role""Data analysis""
And now continue with second one that is ""Data science"".
The two things that i like in explorin is 
First all the learning are categorised in goal
So after completing first goal anyone feel that their efforts works  and then they  exicted about next .
And second is mentorship that if anyone stuck at any problem he free to talk with mentor .
Second thing that fascinated me  is one month of college life .
During it i make many friends and playing many game and Enjoying many chappo.
Online semesters is like a virtual world and after arriving college i meet many real character of that virtual life .

1. When i began my role, I underestimated the power of excel.. as I didn't know then that it is such a powerful tool...
2. In this you can make tables..(ah normie..) is it ?... So in this tool u can actually do whatever you want with that table (sorting, searching , filtering the data , maths , making data graphs etc... ) without a single line of code.... 
2. Did I just said without codes...?  Yes.. but This doesn't make it limited though you have a vast amount of boolean functions here which u can use to do whatever u want... and if you wanna put some effort in coding stuff then congrats... excel has coding help tool (vba.. I call it as codinghelp tool 😅 ) too to design your functions..
3. Umm thinking that it doesn't have designing material.. so no it has that too... Imo a complete pack to analyze and organize your data...

So, don't let this limit yourself and instead design what feels good to you, with the aim that you convey the core message to the viewer. And then iterate on the feedback from experts.

1) Things are good till post tax EBIT. But assumption that reinvestment deducted from this EBIT = FCFF is incorrect. Because not only it assumes high amount of CapEx without keeping into consideration financials, but also does not factor in depreciation, interest and working capital.

2) Derive FCFF using the standard process: EBIT (1-T) + Dep - WC - CapEx

3) Project Depreciation as a % of revenue.

4) Take the WC in terms of days. Calculate last 3 years Working Capital Days. Either take an average of three or keep the existing number of days and forecast it further. Derive the working capital value from revenues forecasted and assumed number of wc days.

5) CapEx figure can be forecasted by checking financials if they have made any CapEx historically or not. It’s not necessary that there would be investments made every year. So keep it constant I would suggest.",null,null,finance,null,0,1023,2022-01-19

I’m not sure why would you say that CapEx - Depreciation + WC = reinvestment. Depreciation is a non cash expense.

Even if we assume for a minute that the logic of reinvestment is correct, then think about it this way. Is there actually that high amount of reinvestment needed for the company every year? Is there a need to have a higher working capital cycle and higher CapEx every year? Because there should be scaling benefits and over a period of time working capital cycle will reduce.

1) Minimalistic approach is not followed- lots of illustrations and lots of colors used and lots of things going on. 

2) Hierarchy is not considered- the first thing you need to tell viewers is 'what is this about?' So this is birthday invitation poster for kabir. But here ""kabir"" comes so lower in hierarchy in your poster. And address and date placed so vertically upward when this is last thing viewer want to see.

3) Seems like birthday party is happening in beach. So try to make the background related to beach.",null,"👍 (1),👀 (1)",design,null,2,544,2022-01-20

Just completed my 3rd Role of Data Science.. 😆 
This was probably my most enjoyable working day as I was not expecting to complete it today but those pretty libraries of sklearn along with pandas made my coding work soo easy..🙃 
Here are my workings and learnings...

1. First I learn the mathematical concept Linear regression and I was like.. Wow! Can we make predictions on basis of linear algebra.. It was like I was thinking of some magic that can happen with LA somewhere in back of my mind.. comes true!!
Yes! that Linear Regression thing is very nice when used in making predictions.. Although math behind this is not that easy yet it seems much easier than you think when you code it with the help of libraries.😋 

2. Then I learnt about Clustering and it works like... You are given some goats with features of goat like it have horns, four legs, weight etc.. and many other animals too without reveling what they are(you will not given that animal with horns and four legs is a goat..).
Now you have to cluster them such that goats are with goats and like that..
and bingo just pass data into k means clustering thing and it will do it for you!..
And if you have interest about how it is done.. it is basically all basic math based on geometry and linearity..

Feeling very happy after completing this..   😇",null,"❤️‍🔥 (5),😍 (2),🔥 (5),💯 (1)",software-development,null,13,1331,2022-01-20

It was much more interesting that i initially though and goal 3 was very interesting.
Pandas is very powerful library and with it you can analyze the data in perfect way, writing the code is very simple and short

1st one: that cake is not looking like a birthday cake, or i must say is not giving bday vibes.

2nd one: It fulfils the most design principles other than minimalism. But it could be improved by using better illustration and background . The current ones are not very visually appealing.

Chapter 9 Done

1. Usability testing is shown of great use but I am not able to feel its importance. So can you guys give me some real-life example of a usability test.

2. {It’s much better, to say “Find a book you want to buy, or a book you bought recently” than “Find a cookbook for under $14.”} What does this sentence trying to convey?

3. It is obvious that one will think of adding a description to make something clear. On the other hand, taking something to reduce noise seems really creative but can I have some example that how it works.",null,null,writing,null,0,564,2022-01-25

#1.  First iteration focuses on highlighting glossy texture of chocolate and red strawberries...main slide has gradient with two shades of choclate while the time-venue info is displayed in red wine color to draw ur attention towards strawberries. Different font styles (its cursive inspired by melting texture of chocolate) and font size are used to try to follow heirarchy for clear reading.
#2. The second iteration looks simple but it has deep sense. For instance, the alcoholic wine is sharing the screen with two stars.. these two stars are placed for following 2 reasons:
(a) two stars are overlapped to form a sign of electric charge (energy)
(b) these stars can be compared with two friends enjoying party just by hanging their shoulder around each other.
#3. The third iteration is displayed in a bit informative way with a tint of golden sparkles to reflect shine, color for nocturnal party vibes. I have also tried to give it a royal look by putting border element in rectangle at centre.
#4. This iteration has its all eye on funky font and blue balloons...the other info is shown on a shape which resembles the shape of balloon.",null,🔥 (1),design,null,1,1184,2022-01-25

Talking of my experience, when i did user testing for explorin's initial website, i found that users are skipping a complete page because the first section looked similar to a previous page, so they were thinking its a same page! 

Generally speaking- It is done to compare whether the user journey is similar to what we thought it would be! All the differnces seen , are then noted down and optimised with iterations.",null,🔥 (2),writing,null,2,496,2022-01-25

You must have read it in '**Omit needless words**' in Don't make me think. Other than typeface of Main text can be improved. And those stars are indeed giving the party vibes but can't relate much with your ideas specially the ""b"". **And want to know your reason behind placing that left line?**

3) All those yellow glitters and furthur yellow text on top **makes it difficult to read**. Also it seems quite blurry..  and maybe try shifting the right box bit lower to maintain the top to bottom hierarchy.

4) **Font sizes and type face** need to be reconsidered. Go through the typography section of the material i shared with you and after that try making changes to it.

I'm Akash and today I started my first personality goal. I read about Avoidance Coping (a coping mechanism which mainly includes avoidance or ignoring the situation).
The small videos and notes given me a whole new perspective of tackling a problematic situation. I learnt why we usually exhibits this type of behaviour and which is because we sometimes think that we can stop talking and keep avoiding the person or situation and that's going to make things slowly fine, but that doesn't happen. All it do is creating more misunderstanding and distances. There are more losses that one faces due to such behaviour such as indecisiveness, delays in works and emotional outbursts. This type of behaviour is not healthy for relationships, friendships.
The few techniques that one can use to overcome such issues is :
     Identify : Identify the situations that you've been avoiding recently. Sit down silently, focus on what you have done in past day or days which may have caused issue. Try to remember what you should've not done.
    Accept : Denial is always bad for personal growth as well as growth of relationship. All you have to do is accept. Go ask for forgiveness if you had a fight with a friend, or try to forgive that person and free you mind from constant restlessness.

Thanks for this great learning, I'll surely try to implement these techniques in my life to avoid personality losses.",null,🔥 (2),fundamentals,null,2,1409,2022-01-27

I'm Lomsha. Today I completed my first goal of personal exploration. I understood about the importance of self talks on a person's life. What you feed to yourself is what you reflect. Talking to yourself about negative aspects of you will only train your subconscious brain to build a wrong attitude that would only lead to destruction of your own happiness. Positive self talks foster confidence, self-esteem and sometimes leads to achievement of seemingly impossible goals. 
For this we need to IDENTIFY: negative aspects of self talks
ELIMINATE: replace the wrong feedings to right feedings 
SELF-SUFFICIENT: Believe you are enough for yourself.
SURROUND: Surround yourself with good people.
I will try to ensure that I am going ahead with these learnings.",null,🔥 (2),fundamentals,null,2,773,2022-01-27

Today I completed my second goal of personal exploration. I found the benefits of self mirror talking. I got to learn that if we keep feeding our subconscious brain with confidence and self worth, it will respond accordingly and help prepare ourselves for difficult situations.
The process I learnt to accomplish this is as follows: 
Look into the mirror and say I am proud of you for .......... and fill this with three different endings and do it consistently for 30 days. It would magically help build a strong personality.

1. Sharing a learning from the book I completed a couple of days before:
The book was about a dystopian futuristic society where emotions and individuality are conditioned out of children at a young age.
Hence, whenever somebody feels negative or upset emotionally, they take a medicine called 'soma"" which cures the negative emotions and makes them happy.
This made me realize how lucky we are that we experience and live with both the negative and positive types of emotions. It's such a wonderful thing to persevere, endure and face emotional challenges. A journey of ups and downs is what makes us celebrate the wins🥳 .

From now, whenever you are not feeling or doing good, just remember whether it would be any good if you were deprived of that emotion forever. Just enjoy the mere existence of that emotion.",null,null,reading,null,0,828,2022-01-29

Read an article about product management. 
It covered the essence of the domain in a simple manner. Hence, I got more clarity on defining what is product management.

So, it is basically a strategy driven domain, where the product manager is responsible for the overall development of the product from ideation to communicating the vision, ensuring the direction of the decisions, to the post launch analysis then iterating. This cycle keeps on repeating and forms the basic steps of the role.

Completed my goals on mindfulness today.

 Well, I started my mindfulness journey exactly a year ago. I have been following Headspace and resonate with their ideas of mindfulness which were very similar to what I experienced in today's exercise.

Even though I have purchased the subscription to Headspace, my regularity takes a toll as we tend to get caught up in day to day thoughts a lot. Our restless thinking mind never stops creating stories.

 There are two things : thinking about mindfulness and meditation vs practicing mindfulness. When we start, we feel good and after some continuity many will fall into the trap of thinking about meditation. We need to moving out of the thinking and simply experience the present. 

I am at this stage right now.
Last year was a journey which was very irregular. But having experienced the vastness that comes with mindfulness, I aim to be more regular this year.

I've completed the Assignments.
Applying learnings to a practical cause is really satisfying and mind opening. Although I have to say Pandas Profiling make a lot of task easier but still it's a job to get insights from those plot. EDA of stock price data and then predicting closing prices is a task which can be a gold mine if done accurately. I've learned to gain insights from the feature plotting. I got to know how one can find correlated features in a Data and finding outliers was also a cool task. I really liked the way we use the maths here. We've already studied Prob and Stats but actually using standard deviation and Z-score to find outliers in the data is very satisfying. 
I also learned scaling of Data although it wasn't in the learning but encountered it in a blog somewhere so thought of applying it in the task.
Linear Regression is somewhat of a complex linear algebra but applying it to make predictions of trends which vary linearly at some extent was very cool job I found.
I although made a mistake that I realise now is that I took very few training samples. I took around 160 training samples but should've taken more. Since I've submitted the task file I can't update it now but I'm practicing the task with a large value of training sample.

Because I have personally noticed it helps in self-realization(of our problems, our weakness ), so that we can fix our inner flaws.

A- Activation which means how many people took the first important step that is they gave you any sort of their information or anything that could be the first step towards contribution of your north star metric

R- Referral which means to how many other people they refer to your product which also means whether they are happy or not with your service
R- Revenue which means a customer finds your product enough valuable that they are willing to pay for your service

I have completed the assignments..
In my first role of data science and analytics, I learnt many things there as I mentioned before... this time it was like practically using them as the way I want in analysing, cleaning and predicting the data... 
The First thing which amazed me here was Pandas profiling and you know it just give u a quick analysis about the data with suitable graphs in just one line of code...
Also, using various libraries to plot graphs in practice notebooks given to us seems fascinating !! 
The other thing for which I was very curious was the prediction using linear regression!! Before this I learnt many new terms like volume, stocks etc.. in stock marketing so that I can understand what I am going to predict... the prediction thing was practically  few lines of codes(thanks to python and its libraries) but the predictions made was astonishing!!

I loved how you thought about it deeply and came up with another A to it which is Awareness. I completely agree with this, it completes the overall journey of a user with a product.
Maybe we can also create a 7th one which captures the users dropping off after retention. 

And regarding your thoughts on these being responsible for the success of a company: 
It depends on what stage a company is in. So, for a company  Acquisition might be the most important metric for the time being whereas this might change to retention when they have acquired a significant number of users.

    GARBAGE IN, GARBAGE OUT: The artist is a collector who collects selectively what they really love. The more good ideas you collect, the more you can choose from to be influenced by. Steal what fuels your imagination. Select the only things that speaks to your soul. Do this and your work is authentic.
    CLIMB YOUR OWN FAMILY TREE: To build trust in artists, not art…Follow an action that read about one thinker you love. Then find out everything about people to whom thinker loved. Follow this to see yourself as part of a creative lineage will help you feel less alone as you start making your own stuff.
    SCHOOL YOURSELF: One should be curious about the world in which he lives. Chase down your reference after looking at things. Then, google everything. Don’t worry about doing research. Just search.
    SAVE YOUR THEFTS FOR LATER: Keep a swipe file with you to keep a track of things swiped from others. These swiped things should be worth stealing.",null,💯 (3),writing,null,3,1501,2022-02-05

So topic that i am going to tell you about is The value proposition canvas.
It has two segment one is for product and other one is for customer.

Customer segment :- it has three sub part that is 

Customer Gains:- these are the outcomes that customer want to have or whatever has been expected from the product it has been upto expectation. It should be as concrete as possible.

Customer Pains:- these are the negative points which means that product has not been upto the expectations of the product or it is preventing customer from fulfilling its job. It should also be concrete as possible.

Customer Jobs:- it is something that customer wants to be completed it can be solving a problem or trying to perform any task.

Now coming to product segment it also has three sub parts 

Product and services:- it simply means what a product is all about or what is the service provided for each persona.

Gain creators:- it refers to how product create benefits to the user or outcome is satisfactory to the user.

Pain relievers:- it address the customers top pain points.

1. Why this Value proposition canvas(vpc) has specificaly addressed product &  customers only ? Why not something else?
2. In product subpart, how is gain created and pain relieved different? Like I can say, whatever pain your product relieves is gain created for me.
3. Is this vpc only limited till here? 
Or  is it  generalised? For example, you are writing here, so you are creating some value for yourself and for the community, so can we use vpc to address value proposition in  this scenario also?",null,👍 (1),finance,null,1,586,2022-02-09
8.22772E+17,Mohit#8674,2022-02-09 00:45:00,"1. The VPC should have only these 2 components only that are product and customers because other than these two you as a product owner or developer is left and know one so your primary focus is  customer satisfaction and you will work upon your product as the customer demands and behave to the product.
2. It varies from person to person. It is true that whatever is a pain reliever for me can be  a gain creator of your. This is just to help the product manager in prioritising the  product in which one the team has to focus more.
3. No VPC is applicable to all the product and all kind of people taking the example of this community

Customer job :-  expecting from the community to gain experience of every field.

Customer Gains:- a student exploring a. Particular field come here and gain knowledge of other field as well and can clear his doubt as well.

Customer pains:-  it can be some student who want to explore any other field other than these 14 has to go somewhere else.
Possible that the resources provided are not good enough for someone.

Product :- building a community of students and mentors to give the knowledge and experience of every field they are interested to explore

Gain:- gives the knowledge and exposure to every field they wish to.

Pains:- can be mentors not supportive, resources are not satisfactory etc.

Now today I will be telling about KANO model of finding opportunities.
It has three principles that a product need to achieve to be successful over time:-
1. Value attracts customers.
2. Maintaining the quality, that builds loyalty.
3. Innovation to distinguish you from competitors.

Now mapping these principles:-

Basic Features:- These are the features that customers expect you to have. You cant get these features from surveys or interviews. For example, if your product doesn't have a password recovery option then it doesn't leave a positive impact on the user however if you have a very fast password recovery option then that doesn't mean that you leave a positive impact that means the level of unhappiness is decreased.

Performance Features:-These are the things customers are judging your product it is mainly the services you are providing. It also depends on how well you executed them. You can easily get these from an interview or a survey form. It could be the satisfier for the customer. For example, fast service leads to high satisfaction.

Excitement Features:- These are the features that is most difficult to find. You wont find it with customers interviews or surveys. These are the features that user dont know about. For example, getting WI-FI in midflight would be an wow experience. It will help you be above your competition.

Now as the time passes all the product lets take it aswifi in midflight for the first time it would be good but as soon as the time passes it shifts to performance features like if they get poor signal then that would be bad.

Our mind's are built against delayed gratification. In ancient times, when we were hunter gatherers, we were not even sure whether we will be alive tommorrow or not. So our primary aim was to maximize returns in short term. World evolved faster than our biological brain, today we are secure than than anytime ever before . We are still programmed to maximize returns in short term compromising huge long term gains. All sort of instant 
pleasures cigarette ,alcohol ,drugs, porn, gambling, calorie dense foods will give you pleasure in short term but the opportunity cost is very high. But this coginitive bias can be handled by acknowledging it consciously and programming our subconsious for all delayed gratification activities. Regularly doing physical activity ,control over fancy foods will give you a healthy body capable of doing miracles in long term and there are bunch of other examples.

he mindset framework summarizes research on how people think, feel, and respond to failure and challenging experiences. Individuals who believe that intelligence and ability are largely immutable (‘fixed mindset’) respond to failure by withdrawing, disengaging, or persisting with the same set of strategies despite their prior demonstrated ineffectiveness.

On the other hand, students who believe they can substantially increase their intelligence and ability through experience and effort (‘growth mindset’) often react to academic challenges by allocating more effort, experimenting with new approaches, and seeking feedback.

2) Go ahead and do whatever you are passionate about, life's not a measuring competition you just need to go ahead with whatever you are doing.

I am overwhemled to see you sharing this with us. Everyone wants to show their best life as if it is perfect like shown on instagram. It takes guts to be vulnerable & sharing this side to others.

Goal 1: In the situation when we don’t have people to discuss the career related issues can definitely effect us badly as we take wrong decisions. So, if we do not have people around us, we can take help of some internet resources or some stuff related to that but we should not take the decision in a hurry without seeking proper guidance.
 Goal2: In these situations, we generally have fear in expressing ourselves as we are afraid of the judgement that people would make for us. So, we should express ourself properly, because when we express ourself properly ,and people listen to us there are major chances that they understand our point.
 Goal3: After going through this exercise I realized that to continue any task or job we need people having same mindset. It is very necessary to make such community around us. Again, this can be done by having proper communicatin skills.",null,🔥 (1),fundamentals,null,1,1004,2022-02-13

1. Lack of minimalistic approach: Too crowded with unnecessary elements and illustrations.

2. The purpose of introducing a thick border with yellow color is not clearly demonstrated.

3. You may explore some appealing font styles.

2nd Iteration:

1. Visual imbalance: The elements seem to be placed without a proper visual hierarchy.

2. Dress Code theme: The code mentioned is blue. However, it is not being reflected from the poster theme.

3rd Iteration: Amazing! 

1. Lack kf minimalistic approach: A couple of elements can be eliminated to make it a bit spacious.

1. Unreliable text placement: The right side placement of the text looks strange since the human eyes' reading pattern is zigzag; from left to right.

 1st iteration review-
1. Too crowded with the elements which don't even connect to the poster- Just stay with the theme, color palette and start basic. It will take time but you will learn some new things. 

2. Font can be improved- The sub-text and their font weights can be improved. Shortlist some fonts and try them on the poster and compare which one's looking better. 

2nd iteration-
Information is not altogether. Its giving me more cognitive load to read it-- A solution can be to try to focus more on how the information is being given to the users and then look at its design. 

2. Colors- Important things are not highlighted just because the color is not contrasting enough from the background-  Try to create contrast. 

3rd iteration-
1. Font style can be improved. 
2. Space is never bad in any design- so try to focus more on that. 

4th iteration-
1. Hierarchy can be improved to make it give less effort to understand. Don't size is not consistent. 

 5th iteration-
1. Too much border thickness. 
2. Font can be improved. 
3. Text placement can be improved. 

6th iteration-
1. Font style can be improved.

    IMPOSTER SYNDROME: We scare to start, which is quite natural. We should overcome this by just start making stuff via thinking that we’re ready!
    FAKE IT UNTIL YOU MAKE IT: Pretend to be something you’re not until you are or this can be done during making of something!
    START COPYING: Copying should not be misunderstood with plagiarism. Plagiarism is copying someone’s work and presenting it to others as your own. It is reverse engineering. We should know who to copy and what to copy. Who to copy is easier to know as it is basically what we love and what inspires us. What to copy is bit tricky since we don’t just steal the style, else we steal the thinking behind the style. The reason to copy your heroes and their style is so that you might somehow get a glimpse into their minds.
    IMITATION IS NOT FLATTERY: After sometime, imitation changes to emulation. Emulation is making your imitation as your own by making changes to it. Process to emulate is simple. One should copy, then find the where it falls short. It should be amplified by your own style which will make it yours! Merely imitating your heroes is not flattering them. Transforming their work into something of your own is how you flatter them.",null,🔥 (2),writing,null,2,1313,2022-02-15

Goal 2: Choosing a path which is not a standard one is often discomforting due to the uncertainty in the path's direction. Furthermore the fear of getting away from the main stream is trembling. I believe following our passion, taking risks on the way in consideration could be a solution to the problem.

Personal Goal #1 - Career Dilemma
I was in a situation to decide what I should do. Then, I decided to go and try things by myself, but nothing seemed to provoke the curiousness in me and excite me until finally, case-solving did. Later, found out that consultants do similar stuff as a professional. The solution goes a lot in line with how it happened to me.
Personal Goal #2 - Road not Taken
It is a problem that arises due to a lack of self-belief as you are doing something which no one else is, and having someone to support you on that road when you have that fear of failure in your mind is undoubtedly a blessing. I think we should re-evaluate the path we are on to cure the problem of self-belief.
Personal Goal #3 - Let's Settle
Settling is something that takes you away from your life goals & makes you not push yourself to your max potential. It restricts your growth & hence, one should never settle no matter what. Once, you have identified your interest & goals, you know that you are going to achieve them. That is the required mindset.

Goal 1 : I do not have to imagine this situation because I've been through one in my 10th standard, it was a small fight with Mr. X regarding some topic and I didn't try to fix things out. He was one of my best friends and I still regret spoiling a great friendship. So I would try not to do the same mistake again by making the first move.

Goal 2 : Automatic negative thoughts are very difficult to deal with, they also have various side-effects such as reduced productivity, fragile nature and anxiety. Solution to this problem can be achieved by meditation. Meditation helps you to analyze your thoughts and provides you a healthy and positive mindset. 

Goal 3: So now the problem is reacting to a situation under pressure. Impulsive behaviour and wrong decisions followed by regret are the outcome of such reactions. Keeping mind under control in such situations is the way to solve this problem, the simple way to do this is concentrating on your breath for a minute before you take a decision. Practicing vipassana in my knowledge is the best way to remain calm in even the worst situations, it helps us to control our mind and remain it in perfect equanimity or samata .",null,❤️‍🔥 (2),fundamentals,null,2,1193,2022-02-19

Goal 1 : Misconceptions in professional life happen when there is lack of guidance, under confidence and/or lack of knowledge. One fails to judge their potential and a common question "" Can I do it? "" strikes repetitively. If this misconception persists then it may lead to a directionless path or working inefficiently. This problem can be resolved by proper interaction and guidance. Connecting to various people brings clarity to the issue. Spending time with like-minded people increases productivity and interest in the field.

Goal 2 : Lack of communication can happen in various situations, say when you want to keep something private or you don't want to interact at that moment. It becomes a problem when you're unable to communicate when you want to, the reason could be fear of judgement, lack of confidence or having preconceived notions. To solve the issue, you initially want to have a community with whom you feel comfortable, interacting with these people will boost your confidence, thereafter you should think from other's perspective in order to make the communication more efficient and meaningful.

Goal 3 : Being stuck in a situation feels powerless and suffocating. Many a times, being stuck causes hinderance in growth and may also cause mental stress. On the other hand, I feel getting in such circumstances provides an opportunity to come out stronger and be consummate than before. Now how to come out of it ….. reaching to people who are willing to provide a supporting hand, sharing your problems and vision with them will thereby yield positive outcomes.

career dilemma
This is the most common issue among my peers and the solution to this is proper guidance by someone who is an expert in a field and shear determination by one to get a sone knowledge in a particular field and then decide to continue it or not.

road not taken
Due to lack of time and other constraints people often give up their dreams and do something that doesn't give them satisfaction. The solution to this is that one should follow the path even if he is alone and should keep fighting even if they face failures.

let's settle
Too often I see people settling for things that are lower than their potential. In this case one should continuously evalute himself and if he/she is not happy about the decision they should talk to someone and get an advice what they should do to continuosly grow.",null,💯 (1),fundamentals,null,1,820,2022-02-21

three goals. I have learned the following points:
Goal 1: career dilemma
It's obvious that when we enter college life and see that many people are doing one thing let's say software development. so I will also start doing that thing no matter I am interested in that or not. it is because of a lack of guidance. So, if we do not have people around us, we can take help of some internet resources or some stuff related to that but we should not decide in a hurry without seeking proper guidance.
Goal 2: road not taken
It is a problem that arises due to a lack of self-belief as you are doing something which no one else is, and having someone to support you on that road when you have that fear of failure in your mind is undoubtedly a blessing. In these situations, we are generally afraid to be judged by other people. So, we should express ourselves properly, because when we express ourselves properly, and people listen to us there are major chances that they understand our point.
Goal 2:let’s settle
We should not settle for less but instead, fight for more. We should settle our goal and start fighting for that goal. There may be different paths but our goal should be fixed. Settling gives you long-lasting regret & breaks down your confidence while by not settling you get a feeling of achievement, your confidence on the peak and you learn to be a warrior.

#5. SIDE AND ARE PROJECTS HOBBIES ARE IMPORTANT.
    PRACTICE PRODUCTIVE PROCRASTINATION: It’s good to engage ourselves in too many projects at the same time so that you can switch among them! TAKE TIME TO BE BORED. When you have nothing to do, it can lead you to focus on things more clearly! So, try to take out some time for yourself.
    DON’T THROW ANY OF YOURSELF AWAY: For instance, if we have different passions, don’t try to struck on any one of them. This will leave you in regret that you are lagging in something! Don’t worry about a grand scheme or unified vision for your work. Don’t worry about unity—what unifies your work is the fact that you made it.",null,🔥 (1),writing,null,1,691,2022-02-25

#6. THE DO-GOOD SHARE IT SECRET: WORK AND WITH PEOPLE.  
    IN THE BEGINNING, OBSCURITY IS GOOD: When in the beginning, when there is no captive audience, you can do what you want. There’s no pressure! This freedom can work wonders for you…just use it when no one is noticing you because once everyone is paying attention to you, you’ll never get this freedom. ENJOY YOUR OBSCURITY WHILE IT LASTS. USE IT.
    THE NOT-SO-SECRET FORMULA: For becoming known, there’s no such formula. JUST DO GOOD WORK AND SHARE IT WITH PEOPLE (on internet). STEP1: Wonder at something. STEP2: Invite others to wonder with you. When you open up your process and invite people in, you learn.

I think we often find ourselves in a dilemma where we don't ask the right questions to ourselves. We are too afraid to ask them. We focus on the short-term benefits rather than looking it at a bird view.
Goal 2: Road not taken
Most of us do not try the road not taken and even if we try and explore there is information in abundance where we focus on the pros and not balancing it out with the conc. Its's all well and good untill it's time we face the conc.
Good 3: Let's Settle

Generally there are two times when a customer interview usually takes place, the former happens at the beginning of the product process, and the later will happen once we’ve started building something.
In the beginning the goal the main purpose of survey or interview is to figure out whether to build a given thing or not rather than t to conduct user testing/research to see if we’ve built a particular thing well

It’s a way to validate if the people you think are your customers truly are the right customers and confirming you’re on the right path. Fundamentally, it’s a conversation and an exchange of information. 

Customer development is not a way for people to give you a wish list. It’s not a focus group to only see how people respond to ideas. It’s not a place to observe how customers use your prototype. It’s also not a replacement for product vision. Customers will give you a huge wish list, but they’ll often ask for more than they actually need, end up not using features

Interviews

Interviewing is an incredibly valuable skill because it’s an effective and low-cost way to validate your opportunity hypothesis. 
Just like how you don’t walk into a job interview without preparing, or a meeting without anticipating a desired outcome, customer interviews take preparation.

Some points you should note down before taking any customer interview:-
Write down a list of what you know factually 
What you’re assuming about our customers, including their needs
How your product satisfies them

Some models that can help you get your questions answered are as follows:-

Business Model Canvas can help you identify key assumptions. Of course, customers can help you validate only parts of the canvas that apply to them
Value Proposition Canvas to identify what you know for sure and what you’re assuming are your customers’ existing pains and desired gains",null,🔥 (3),finance,null,3,1893,2022-02-28
8.22772E+17,Mohit#8674,2022-02-28 22:41:00,"A very good way of writing your hypothesis is as follow:- 

I believe that <personas/segments> experience <this pain> when doing <task> because of <limitation> , and alleviating that pain would let the customer <achieve this gain> , although she’d have to <accept these limitations>.
Some points to remember the screener questions  of the right customers are as follows :-

Try to hide the “right” answer so that people don’t answer with what they think you want to hear. 
The most important thing to know is that, whether they realise it or not, people are going to try to please you.
It’s also really valuable when you ask questions that get customers to tell you stories rather than giving simple yes/no answers.


Rather than asking customers if they’d like your feature/product— because they’ll say yes—it’s better to find out about how they deal with the fundamental problem you’re trying to solve. The simplest way to ask a question like this is, “Tell me about how you do <topic> today.”",null,🔥 (3),finance,null,3,995,2022-02-28

Avoidence coping
Sometimes we ignore our feelings so that we don't get hurt or we don't spoil our relation with others, this is avoidence coping. But this is very harmful in long run as what goes comes around. So instead of temporarily avoiding some bad feelings we should face the situation and even if it hurts or ruins some relations we should do the things that are best for our mental and physical health.

Automatic negative thoughts
ANT's are very difficult to deal with. They disturb our regular routine and decrease our productivity and on some days we can't cope up with them which leads to depression or anxiety which is bad for both physical and mental health. To cope up with them one can meditate or read a book or analyse the source and talk about it with someone.

React
Sometimes we react impulsively which lead to bad situations which are harmful for both us and community. To avoid this one needs to be calm and composed and assess the situation before reacting(P.S I need to learn this :p).",null,null,fundamentals,null,0,1092,2022-03-01

When you're conflicted with the other personality rather than solving or dealing with it directly we often choose to delay it or wait for the time when we get a chance to avenge. I think we never get over the situation until it's completely dealt.  This brings us to the next mechanism
Automatic Negative Thoughts -
When the situation has not been put to rest. The negative energy has filled our minds where we can't even focus on the good that's in front of us. It disturbs our focus, lessens our productivity, and raises self-doubt.
React-
We should realize that it shouldn't be always about the payback. We often see this when someone apologizes or initiates a conversation after a quarrel. All of a sudden all the negative energy vanishes and we start introspecting that we could have been the bigger person.

Misconceptions : Misconceptions in career can happen when we don't have like minded people to discuss our query or lack of knowledge or die to lack of confidence. Misconceptions also lead to low efficiency and some bad decisions. One can solve his/her misconceptions by talking to people who have been through the same process and being around like minded people who can provide timely and good guidance.

Communication Issues: Lack of communication can happen when you want to keep something a secret or you don't have trust on the other person or you are afraid of being judged. One can solve this problem by becoming a part of a community that is supporting and always has each other's back and start to communicate and clear the air instead of building more trust issues.

Feeling stuck: Feeling stuck can be growth hindering and bad for mental health as we think about the same problems everyday without getting any solutions. We can come out of it by fonding a group of people who believe in us and are ready to invest in us and themselves, a community that is aware what they want to do.",null,null,fundamentals,null,0,1106,2022-03-02

Goal1- Career Dilemma
Making a decision of what to do in life professionally is really a difficult task. People disguisedly make this decision on various other factors like financial security, peer pressure,etc instead of finding their real interests.  Spending time on exploring interests is the hour of need and i find this solution helpful. 

Goal2- Road not taken
As every individual's mind is unique, so they do have capability to build new careers. The paths which haven't been taken conventionally. To explore that, roadmap must be created else there would be confusion and one must feel aimless. This can be achieved by discussing your opinions among sane community and gather useful things.

Misconceptions-
On the path of exploration, we have information in abundance. Categorized into two: 
1- Information we lookup
2- Information we make up
If we move forward with a half set of correct information can lead us to false hopes, a negative outlook, and lowers our morale. Quality interactions can help resolve this issue.
Communication issues:
The thought or a feeling should be clear to us before it gets delivered. Emphasizing your pronunciation and accent is secondary translating the feeling is primary.

To avoid stressful social encounters or may be many other reasons, we tend to keep some things to ourselves instead of talking it out. But our mind keeps hovering on to that particular thing subconsciously. So the solution given to feel and express our feelings is an apt way to get out of it. 

Goal2- ANT
Overthinking and approaching a situation with pessimistic thoughts clearly drains us mentally and physically. We should convert ANT to PET by analyzing what triggers us and consciously try to imbibe optimism.

It involves people making very sophisticated decisions on the spur of the moment, without the benefit of any kind of script or plot.

It was a great experience for me to shoot this short film .I roamed for few days cluelessly in the campus , market and few other places . I saw one common thing  everywhere that is colour .In the very first part I showed the beauty that arise from artificial things and then from the natural ones  .It was a challenging task for me as I go through many situations in which I had to work with the things in which I was not comfortable I learned many new things like video, audio editing etc. 
I am very happy to share this short film with you all .

Talking about the other feedback-
1) Try making the background color bit more vibrant and such that contrast can also improve for text.
2)Icons are extremely bold here. They are needed to be minimalised. 23 written inside does not provide good readability. May be reducing the stroke weight or putting it outside may help.
3) You can further improve the heirarchy of ""kabir birthday party"" text by increasing the stroke weight. Since address and time stroke seems more than this one.
4) Then the next thing is visual balance on both left and right side is needed to be reconsidered. That's what @Keshav Bidawatka is pointing to!

I am from Hardoi (UP). I love playing badminton and table tennis.I tried many things to know about the field which could fascinate me.Few of them are mechanical core, robotics, blockchain development. But none of them looked to be a good career option for me. I even started doing CP just because of peer pressure. 
After all these trials I have realised the importance of knowing about my interests. My primary dream is to discover my passion and then work hard in an appropriate direction to be good at it.

Got some answers about this question today.

A user is one who uses your product and a customer is someone who pays for your service.

For example suppose a dog owner is buying a doog food so the dog is the user and the dog owner is the customer for the brand.

But the user and customer can also be same. For example a Netflix user who buys the subscription also uses that subscription for himself. So in this case he is both user and customer.

 Wanted to share something which @Explorin made me realise today:
We are social beings and have people around us in our everyday life. 
But we often tend to just ignore them as if they don't exist which actually is a dent to the mutual self-respect.

For example: We daily encounter the hostel security guards, mess workers, etc but when our eyes contact, we just ignore them. Instead what if we said 'Good morning uncle, aap kaise ho?' and converse a bit if we have a minute to spare. That would be a good gesture and encourage mutual self-respect. It would make us energetic.

One day King Hobuchandra told his minister Gobuchandra that he
wished his feet should not get dirty when he stepped on the ground.
Millions of brooms were then purchased to ensure a dust-free kingdom.
But the whole kingdom, the king’s palace, and even the sun, got covered
by the dust raked up by these brooms. The king fell sick and started
coughing and sneezing.
The water from the lakes and ponds was then used liberally to settle
the dust. The kingdom was flooded and, much to the king’s annoyance,
the dust turned into mud.
When this experiment failed, it was decided to cover the earth with
leather. Millions of sheep and goats were then slaughtered but their
hides were not enough to do the trick.
Finally, an old cobbler walked into the royal court seeking an
audience with the king. Sitting at the king’s feet, the cobbler stitched
together a pair of simple leather sandals. Now the king could roam
around in freedom; his feet would not get dirty again.

Conclusion: Much of the bigger problems could be solved with the ""Minimalist approach"".

Assumptions :-
1. Flipkart has a huge range of  electronics items present.
2. Ordered drop is only present in the electronics category.
3. This issue is spread equally in all the regions of the country and is uniform for all of the electronics items.
4. Assuming this drop is the concern for alert.
5. There is no such pattern seen before.
6. Assuming this drop has been equally in both website and application and in both IOS and Android.

External Factors :-
1. Since most of the electronic products are imported from China, has the government imposed some law over it on importing things from China or has changed some rules and regulations in context to importing goods.
2. Are people opposing the goods made in China?
3. Are their any competitors that has done a marketing campaigns which is offering a huge discount on  electronics category
4. Is there any new player in market especially for electronics category who is offering huge discounts
5. Is there any negative news that is being viral for the electronics item bought from flipkart.
6. Are the shop owners and companies breaking out the contracts with flipkarts because they might be getting better offers in some other place(competitors).",null,🔥 (4),finance,null,4,1318,2022-03-13

1. The BI tool which we are using is working properly.
2. Has there been any update from our end? It might not be working for any IOS or android or may not be working properly for a website or app.
3. If the update has only simple UI/UX changes it might be tough for users to understand it. 
4. Since only there is a drop in electronics category orders I am assuming that we have launched an update. The update might contain a bug in the add to cart and checkout process of the electronic category.
5. Have we announced any big billion sale for any other category other than electronics which might have taken the attention of users.
6. If we are giving some discount then people might be facing difficulty redeeming it.

I deciphered that empathy is about stepping in the user's shoes to an extent that you don't get overloaded with emotions.

In order to verbally express our emotions, it is important that we develop an emotional vocabulary. The more specific we can be when we are verbally communicating our emotions, the less ambiguous our emotions will be for the person decoding our message. As we expand our emotional vocabulary, we are able to convey the intensity of the emotion we’re feeling whether it is mild, moderate, or intense.

I found the underlying flow of every interview to be:
1) Ask Clarifying questions
Make sure to get an understanding of the topic, it's context, any constraints and the background information.
# After this step, the key theme of the target should be clear

2) Evaluating user persona
Come up with few user personas according to the target. After describing the personas, continue with a preferable one.
# After this step, The theme, requirement, and target user persona should be clear
{Can also target the pain points of the users}

3) Solution / Structure for the target outcome
Here, considering that specific user persona, come up with some creative solutions. 
# Cover the pros and cons of the solutions you provide and try to come up with a priority matrix to summarize your solutions

#Although many frameworks like CIRCLES could be followed, but best option is to proceed according to the situation and in an interactive manner.

-> Your WACC is too low (~7% is slightly impossible for companies to have in India cause all of them raise debt at 11% ish and equity returns are somewhere around 20%). So overall it should be somewhere around 13% or something.

-> Your beta is again low. 0.21 beta of a stock is irrational. I checked on yahoo finance and it says beta of 1.40. Using this number, the stock price is comes to 112.60 -> closer to actual market price of 106.30rs",null,null,finance,null,0,590,2022-03-16

Just wanted to write this heartfelt note here and i request you all to bear with the length of it-- 

Last 10 days in my life have created a huge impact on me and my beliefs over myself, so incident goes something like this -->

10 days ago, I came to Gurgaon for continuing my  internship in offline mode for a month, and i was pretty much excited about it and at the same time was not that happy as i had to leave campus and i knew i would not be able to hangout with few of my favourite people -- also would eventually miss out my campus's first HOLI, but -->

a week ago -->

here at mooofarm i was finally assigned a project of building a whole web application for them which would involve the use of a complete new technology stack for me -- [NextJS, Tailwind CSS, NodeJS backend, SQL Queries, Express.JS]

and, i was waiting for this project to start from last 1 month, but it got delayed due to some reasons and now the situation was -- My intern is going to end on 5th April, so i was remained with approx.  20 days, and the technical estimate of building that application by the Technological Lead of Mooofarm was ~`28 days` (which was pretty much reasonable as it does involves complete new things and complicated logics)

But at the same time estimating -- I don't know why i uttered out `8 days` from my mouth, and the Co-Founder of Mooofarm turned at me saying if you did it in 8 days -- we're going to celebrate it hard!

and then after when i came home, i eventually had this thought in my mind that `did i just overcommitted it ? `
but i cannot do anything now as -- It's something on my `credibility` , as i myself spoke `8 days`

and then from last `Sunday` -- I started the work -->",null,🔥 (3),life-updates,null,3,1718,2022-03-19

2.) I've set the challenge with Co-Founder that i'll deliver it in 8 days, so it's my on credibility now

And GUYS, TODAY IS SATURDAY -- (7nth day from the start of the timeline) and I've COMPLETED IT.

I can't just express my happiness after completing it, To be honest -- It was really really challenging -- 

I slept only for 3-4 hrs almost daily during the whole last week, literally rubbed out my ass to stand on my words.

The problem highlighted is a serious one, which is, I guess experienced by everyone and only a few try to acknowledge it. Most of us want a try and tested path where we soothe our hearts by seeing our good future that is shown to us by someone else. We dont understand it then but we tend to walk on others interest (whether we are generally not comfortable). We try to supress our gutt feeling or passion just to avoid any risk and gain short term happiness. 
Until we dont have the proper knowledge of various fields and dont know about what people out there are doing , it is not fair on our part to stick to one thing. We should explore our options in the basket and choose the best one suitable for us.",null,🔥 (3),fundamentals,null,3,731,2022-03-20

This is Aditya Mishra, a 2nd year UG student from the mechanical engineering dept.
I currently stay in Rajasthan with my home town being Muzaffarpur, Bihar.
Playing video games, copying assignments, and a couple of club engagements here and there pretty much sums up my college life(till now). I am a part of ShARE IITR, have done a few case studies, and am currently working(in a team) on a given project for a startup. I was also a part of IITRMS and I've done a project under them too. The online work of the club didn't fascinate me so I ended up leaving it(frankly speaking, I kinda regret it though :3).

Talking about my hobbies, I can dance a bit, I started cooking in the lockdown period and loved it, I have tried my hand in mandala art (posted a couple of em' on Pinterest too :p), I am(was) a professional quad skater. I realized in the recent past that 2 years of JEE preparation and 1.5 years of online classes had affected my health adversely as a result of which I have started working on my fitness. My prominent academic accolades include a silver certificate in Technothlon, KVPY scholar, qualified RMO, and clearing JEE(obviously). 
As the intern season was approaching, there was a lot of buzz around me. Different people with different knowledge bases gave different advice creating a fuzz in my mind which left me unsure of what to do. I didn't just want to commit myself to anything without knowing about the various other options available. It was then, when @anuj sir introduced me to explorin. I would thank sir for telling me about this wonderful startup and its community at the right time.
Looking forward to a ton of knowledge and a wonderful experience with the team.",null,❤️‍🔥 (9),intros,null,9,1715,2022-03-21

Goal 1
It's evident that when we first arrive to college, we observe a lot of individuals doing the same thing. Peer pressure would lead to more people doing the same thing, whether or not they are truly interested in it. This is due to a lack of awareness of a number of other fields. It is really tough to decide what to do professionally in life. People make this selection based on a variety of different reasons, such as a steady path, a high success rate, peer pressure, and so on, rather than their true interests. The need of the hour is to spend time exploring different fields which catch our curiosity, and find our true passion.",null,💯 (5),fundamentals,null,5,656,2022-03-21

I wanted to talk about some experiences and realizations that I've felt along my journey. Not being from a Tier 1 college, I always felt that there is a huge gap between my dreams and what could I achieve given my college scenario. Choices I made haunted my sleep. The void of community, mentors, inspirations, and a structured roadmap left me no hope. I was heavily affected by all of this. It's not that I didn't fight my battles. But with community battles looks a lot easier. The way Explorin and @Explorin  held my hand. The gap and void started bridging. I can dare to dream big again. I would also like to thank my dearest friend @anuj  who introduced me to this community which is now a second home to me. About the program -:
1) Started a streak in Physical fitness - before maintaining a streak I just stared at my shoes and ended running plans
2) Started Self-mirror talk - Now I commit things then I am proud of accomplishing them and sleep with fewer regrets and complaints by getting closure on my past mistakes.
3) Focusing on one task at a time - previously I had so much on my plate (Pun intended). Now I do tasks at my own pace and in a more structured way. 
At last, I would congratulate all of us to be in this healthy space. It's a dog-eat-dog world out there and to be in this healthy and inspiring environment is itself a blessing. I would like to connect with each and every person in this community and make good lifelong friendships.",null,"❤️‍🔥 (6),🫂 (1),💪 (5)",daily-experiences,null,12,1576,2022-03-24

This has made me realise the importance of having daily habits. There would be highs and lows. 
There would be days when you won't sense how quickly the day passed, but what would boost you at that time are the habits which you perform everyday.

Those habits would ensure that you are progressing everyday.

So, @everyone if you have been casual about maintaining your daily streaks rethink. 
Just introspect and think about the little time it takes to complete those rituals.

This exercise has helped me to get a reality check. There are some situations where I feel disturbed and not comfortable in. Sometimes after wasting much of my time during the day, I feel guilt at night while sleeping and become very serious about my  life or career(sometimes I can't even sleep).

That Steve Jobs used to say that you have to believe in yourself 
It may seem impossible to you at first. 
But the dots would connect backwards and you would realize that after 10 years or something. 
And one more thing I would like to add that I got rejected by finclub twice
Once in 1 st yr and again in 2 nd yr,so dont worry just be curious and well keep learning

Really inspired by you though.

If you are passionate enough I'm sure you might be running your fund sometime after.

I don’t really have a coding background because till 10th I spent most of my time trying to get the highest marks in my class and I spent my 11th and 12th class preparing for jee while constantly debating in my mind if that is what I really wanted. Some of my hobbies include playing badminton, drawing, dancing (bhangra) and listening to music. I am also trying to inculcate the habbit of reading books. I always thought that gaining the highest marks will help me gain success mainly because it will make my parents feel proud of me. But after getting the highest marks in semester 1, I realised that I don’t want to be a part of this rat race anymore. I want to explore different fields, I want to learn new skills and I want to find something that inspires me to do something, not something I have do but something I want to do. I always wanted to try freelancing but due to hectic college life I haven’t had the time to learn new skills.

1st Lesson -: Great strategies originate in insights that are beyond the reach of conscious analysis, just like great works of art or great scientific discoveries. To let your mind generate those ideas you have to fuel your mind with creative & intuitive thought processes rather than rational ideas. Rationality or technical mastery is required for working out those ideas i.e. testing them, check their implications and ensure execution. Current corporate world is biased towards being rational and hence, losing the high potential ""wild ideas"" that a creative and intuitional mind delivers.",null,"❤️ (1),🔥 (2)",reading,null,3,639,2022-04-12

The shift in their life and the lifestyle degradation they chose to do for their  dreams( to create the biggest ever fund that ever existed), the story is damn too heart wrenching as of now.

7.56951E+17,Keshav Bidawatka#6333,2022-04-16 03:53:00,"Hii @everyone 
Wanted to share something wonderful which happened today.

Today I had my quarterfinal match of the Institute Open, Lawn Tennis.
It's probably the last tournament of my college life.

A few weeks ago, I had performed badly in the Colors Trophy due to performance pressure and a strong desire to win. I was desparate to prove my passion towards tennis.
I had once aspired to be a pro player. Such is my love for Tennis.

But in this tournament I was determined not to think about the result and enjoy it to the fullest.

And I must say it was a pure bliss to play and compete today. My passion and attitude to not care about the result, brought the best out of me.

I was hitting my favourite 'inside in forehand' with sheer confidence and enjoyment.

So, the learning for me is:
 Never stain the sacredness of your passion by tying it to a result.",null,❤️‍🔥 (6),daily-experiences,null,6,862,2022-04-16

Today was an important day for me. I had to put up a presentation on NYKAA in sac oat on behalf of ecell. I had practiced for it a lot but still i had some fear of public speaking. Untill today, everyday i use to think how am i going to start, how will i continue, what if i get stuck in between. The only way i could find to get out of this dilemma was to just pass through the process. I didn't think much about it today and once i started speaking, i gained some confidence and continued.

I am happy today as i consider this a small but major step in my journey of being an entrepreneur. I remember one line from kota factory which motivated me through all this time. It was ""agar problems aa rhi hon to unhe dhun do"". 

Explorin team also helped to get best out of me. Thanks @anuj @Divyansh @SimpHunter @Keshav Bidawatka for taking out some time and helping me to prepare.

So, just wanted to say that not taking risks brings regret in the future. (however, this incident had close to 0 effect but others could cost more.

5.5612E+17,Senpai_JJ#8864,2022-04-21 13:49:00,"There are two type of government policies as mentioned by Prashant. 1) Fiscal Policies, 2) Monetary Policy. The fiscal policies are determined by the government itself, whereas the monetary policy is handled by RBI. Both the bodies are supposed to act in an independent way under ideal scenarios. The actions of government should not have influence over the actions of RBI and vice-versa.

Now coming to what exactly are these two policies. Let me explain you with the help of an example. Assume that India is going through a recession or a downward phase. GDP is constantly dropping. So now, the government and RBI will take measures (independently) to ensure that the economy does not suffer. Government, through it’s fiscal policies may tweak around with its tax structures. Since economy is going in a downturn phase and people might have lost jobs, government will lower the taxes so that there is a relief provided and citizens of India can start consuming/ spending more which may help in boosting the GDP. Other thing it may do is change the expenditure pattern. For example, if government had previous kept higher budgets for defence, then given the current scenarios it may want to deploy excess funds for human welfare and providing monetary relief to people who have lost jobs.

To summarize, fiscal policies are measures taken by government related to expenditure budgets and tax structures under several scenarios. There is no specific agenda or objective that the government may have with regards to fiscal policies determined.

On the other hand, monetary policies are set by RBI and these policies have specific agenda of keeping the inflation rate under control. RBI will take strict measures (tweaking the interest rates, money supply) to ensure that inflation rate is not breached.",null,null,finance,null,0,1801,2022-04-21

Seeing friends roaming the corridors, visiting each other's room with a mysterious fear of how much the other has studied, going to eat in the mess together, and listening to the exam-related table conversations.

You get to see different shades of people which you hadn't witnessed before.
People are riding on high emotions in this period so they more often vent out their frustrations and emotions.

Disclaimer: this may be a really long introduction because I am chirpy bird and can write endlessly. 🙈

So, I am an engineer by my parents' choice and I am a passionate writer by my own choice. So, apart from the mundane (but important :) ) 9 to 5 job, I try to create time everyday for writing. 

I love reading, and talking about anything and everything. Literally anything. (By talking, I mean on text - otherwise I am an introvert) 

My college life was not even near what I dreamt of, but I learnt a lot of life lessons the hard way. All of which I am grateful for.

I felt stressed and fear struck. Went out to do some banter with friends but that doesn't help as it is similar to running away from the situation which will strike back once you leave that localised environment.
Later, sat down and understood the situation I was in, trying to comprehend the situation by talking with others who were in the same course. Accepted that the situation is not in my hands and that now is the time to not dwell on the negatives and focus on and appreciate the positives in the situation. Positives-: I had more syllabus covered than 40% of the batch and had great marks in all the prior exams of course (except 1 viva).
Also, assessed what I can do in the situation (left my mobile phone in the washroom, try to study as much as possible in the time that was left)
Learning-: Stress is only significant if unassessed, as once assessed you will know that 
1. The situation is not in your hands.
2. You have actions that can be taken to improve the situation.
3. Situation is not as bad as you thought it was.

This new channel is created for recording your day planning/goals at the start of your day and be accountable for the goals set.

Taking out 10 minutes at the start of the day to plan out the rest of the day, makes sure that you sail happily through the day and complete your daily habits and goals🌟 

Those 10 minutes of planning can actually make you use your next 16 waking hours effectively in the direction of your dreams 💪

since my ETEs got over on 29nth , I went to Rishikesh alone for 2 days to get to know myself better, to get close to myself and explore Rishikesh!
It was really a great experience out there!
I met several people from different countries (Chile, Germany, Brazil), talked with them, tried to learn about their opinions towards life, and how do they pursue their daily different experiences and learn from them (consciously or unconsciously)

The words I've come back with are - ""Rishikesh is a place of possibilities."", ""Life is only one!"" .

On the 5th of April, I completed all of my goals, read 77 pages of the book (the highest ever in a single night). I was loving it. As usual, planned the next day before sleeping. The next day, My grandmother got admitted to the hospital for a sudden reduction in SpO2 levels. My father was staying at the hospital, sent me home because I had to look out for the business because we knew that the treatment could go a long way. I stayed up the whole night and did not study. Didn't even look at the planner I wrote the night before. From the 6th of April to the 21st of April, My grandmother fought for her life. I remember how one bad news could make our whole day worse and one ray of hope can alter the mood. I felt this same thing last year when my grandfather was in the hospital. During this phase, it's very difficult to monitor your thoughts because you get flooded with negativity and existential questions. But I remember asking myself that ""What's the point of having a life?"". You are born and you grow up, burdened with the responsibilities and then a few years later you find yourself lying on some hospital bed with god knows how many pipes and people beside you begging for your life. On the 21st of April, I lost my grandmother and she left me just one question to ask myself.
What's the purpose of life? and what if you never get to find it. Scary isn't it?. Because you may never get to find it because life is uncertain that's for sure and it is uncertain at the highest point of your life. So it'll be prudent for me, for us, to find that purpose and along with finding that ""One Point"". I am gonna

In the evening, i went to look for a PG for all of us so that we could shift tomorrow. I also got wet in the rain but it was a nice experience and finally i figured out one of the affordable PG for us.
Then after returning, i attended my first townhall meeting which happens on every wednesday and where mainly we discuss on a particular topic. Today's topic was related to managing the priorities and after an hour of discussion we finally figured out that there was a communication gap in team and we had to be more structured. I learned the right use of tools like calendar, clickup, todo, etc. and how from the day 1, i can be efficient. I believe it was a nice decision to onboard a little early.

I am Tanishk.
So today , I got time to express my one experience.I was feeling very nervous before my first stage performance in Hindi. I am very confident on stage . But I am still feeling nervous . 

The appreciation from the audience was very low for previous performances before mine. So , it's giving tension because I am presenting Shayari and it requires a great response. But then I remembered Ram Sir's words that they were before one day of my performance . They said , "" Don't think what people think about you . Just go and give your best. If you fail , you have got some experience . Don't think how it will be. "" And yes then......

I performed very nicely and I got appreciation from everyone. My culture sec , my friends, even Barua Sir also appreciate me for my Shayari . From next , I got famous in my bhawan and people came to me and talked about my performance.
Yes , I made some mistakes but I covered them up. 


And these incidents give me really tremendous confidence that I will do anything in my life .

I have completed my first week of internship and I have noticed a few things which I would love to share with you all.
1. things in a startup are not much organized and many times a person from one domain will have to look at the works of another domain. so, just enjoy doing the work whatever is assigned.

Was getting a gist of corporate life and realised things are damn too slow here. Nobody gives a F if a certain task is not done and this thus displays the importance of task in other people's minds. 

The bootlicking and flattering culture is very very high and it's very competitive here. 

The people are great helpful and really compassionate that is one of the main perks of being here but the strict hierarchy and division of every branch makes it really tough for the job to get done. 

Another learning I had here is I got to know how small mistakes may end up being too big for you. 
I just forget to book my cab one day and had to pay twice the amount to an Auto to get to office.

It was a great mindset shift.

Wanna share with you all...

It's very straight forward that in order to achieve our dreams... We need to become the person worthy of those dreams...

But, personality shift happens gradually...

So, how do I make quality decision now?

BY SHIFTING IDENTITY....

Personality takes time to change but our identity can change quickly coz it's all mindset.

Let's say, the person who is able to achieve my dreams is Splendid Satyam...

But, I, on the other hand is just Satyam.  

So, whenever I have to make any decisions... I ask what would Splendid Satyam do...

Not me but my dream identity.

This one little question has helped me a lot.

Hope it helps you all too..

I am Sparsh Gupta, wanna share some realisation of mine...
I just realised that sometimes we are bound to select the things we own over the things that we like or want.. It may be anything ranging from a toy to a career and also there are many ways which inherit this boundation.. but the most underrated and ignored way is self lie and fear to change(risk factor).. 
Obviously lying to oneself is a painful task when the innerself knows what the truth is.. but not being able to take the risk, in someway bound us to bear the pain for an unknown time period.. 
So what can we do in this condition..
We have options like..
1. Continue with current thing and continue lying to innerself that this thing is more enjoyable.. maybe eventually you really begin to love this thing.
2. Take risk, either you will get the thing (success) or you will fail, but you can then go back too.. this can cost you some precious things.. but what you gain is flexibility in nature and dare to change...
Both things can be preferred over one another.. but to me second one is better...

8.01666E+17,anuj#7534,2022-05-15 02:51:00,"Learned about the art of taking customer feedback.

Things to keep in mind before taking customer feedback.

1. Take it only when you are ready. 
If your developers and designers i.e. resources you have are not ready to implement what has to be changed, there is no point in taking feedback. Your users will not be keen enough when you will take feedback again because they didn't get to see their previous feedback implemented in the product. User empathy is very necessary, asking questions is always easier than answering them. Making them feel their feedback is just to make the product better which is made for them to make their life easier is very crucial.

2. You have to be open to feedback.
if you only implement feedback that you agree with, it goes against the purpose of the feedback you took in the first place. It is taken to identify your blind spots that you did not think of in the first place. If you discard feedback just because you didn't like them shows you are not open-minded i.e. not open to feedback.

3. Ask the right customer.
Every customer is not the same. If you want to improve your onboarding, ask the customer you have onboarded in the last few days/weeks or who has dropped off in the onboarding stage, It's fresh in their minds.",https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/974650677731143700/975145900370444389/unknown.png,"👌 (5),🔥 (1)",product-management,image,6,1265,2022-05-15

Coz I luckily know something very special about marketing...

Marketing is one of the most undervalued skills...

But, today I wanna share with you all my perspective of marketing..

The point I got sold on marketing...

So, in a business as we all know... Requires 3 main people. 

The entrepreneur, the manager and the technician.

The entrepreneur being the guy who takes butt load of financial risks.

The manager who makes sure that the people work in the right direction and everything is working smoothly...

And finally the technician who creates the product, who does the technical work.

But, very few people know about the 4th secret member... Whom the entrepreneur loves the most.

The Rain Maker.

These are the people who know how to make it rain.

You know how??

Coz they know how to bring Customers...

The lifeblood of a business...

Marketers are those Rain Makers...

They have the skill which can bring life to a dead business... Acquisition of Customers Profitably and continuously.

There is no cap to what these people can make... And they don't need to be attached to any particular business...

Keeping the money aside.

The act of marketing is all about shifting beliefs.

Beliefs are the most integral part of a person's life.

When changed can transform a person completely.

If done in right and responsible way, can change someone's life foreverrr...

That is the responsibility and the power a marketer has.

Being a huge content consumer, I understand how much influence content has on our minds...

The people who control content control beliefs...

And the people who control beliefs control destiny.

Marketers have the power to control destiny of the viewers...

The skill when used to market quality things can change the world for better.

At the end... I just wanna say that..

Good marketing can solve any problem in life ❤️",null,🔥 (5),marketing,null,5,1924,2022-05-15

1. The poster seems a bit blurred. The possible reason would be that would have used very small dimensional image. So use can try using images from unsplash.. and also you may think of exporting postering in 1.5x or 2x rather than in 1x
2. Other than that you can try changing the position of your elements.. text and stars on top of cake is not looking original..

Forced out of bed at 5:57 a.m. when I slept at 4:15 a.m. with an ultimatum to get ready for religious worship until 6:00 a.m. 
Well from my experience, trust me 3 min are enough when someone is consistently shooting words at you.
Post which I was expecting a 30min-1hr of that religious practice which extended to 2-2:30 hrs by the usage of magical sentences
""Bas 2 min aur"" & ""Pooja beech mei nhi chhodte"". 
But, overall a good test of patience for me which I successfully overcame (somehow).
Initially, It was fun and did all the activities with complete interest but as the benchmark of 30min passed the fun part disappeared. With processes getting repetitive, until 1 hr of the benchmark, the interest part also disappeared. Making the last 1.5 hrs, the ultimate test of patience which included holding a vessel at a specific point for close to an hour. Ultimately pushing the limits of pain & patience and of course, the limits of ""Bhakti"" were challenged.

I loved the colour and positioning of gradient!
Other than that, there are few areas where you can still improve:
1) First is typeface: You can definitely find better typefaces. And also You have used two typefaces, both of which are not complementing to each other. Both are very different which is creating chaos. 
Tip- Whenever you use two, use one simple one and other fancy one to maintain the overall balance. And highlight the main text with fancy one and other with simple one. 
2) 2nd thing is font sizes: Font sizes can be improved. For eg. The difference between fonts of ""You are invited to"" and ""Shreyash's"" can be increased. Also Shreyash's should be bolder than You are invited to, considering the heirarchy.
3)Elements- The icon you have used for date and time could be better. This icon are ideally to be used for 24*24 sizes or at max 32*32 but here you have increased its size a lot which make it look weird. You can try using small illustration here instead.
4)Positioning and alignment- Can think of better positioning of bottom section, and also date,time and icon aren't aligned right now. Cake element isn't posited nicely, could better be removed.",null,null,design,null,0,1230,2022-05-16

1.) Images are not being displayed -> 
for this, first make sure that images are being saved properly in your database, look into the administrator panel for images, and if they're being saved properly and visible to you from admin panel -> 

then last step correction would be to correct this part -> 
`<img class=""card-img-top"" src=""${user.img}"" alt=""Card image cap"">` 
this is not the syntax to display images, 
it should be 
`<img class=""card-img-top"" src=""{{user.img.url}}"" alt=""Card image cap"">`
and I would highly recommend you to look at the resources of the platform carefully and read them again, it's clearly explained in detail inside the resources for doing this thing.

2.) User name is not being displayed ->
If you look at your written code, you have provided `author` as a Foreign key relation to `User` Model, and in template, you're trying to display `user.author`, so it's obvious that it would just display the id, as ForeignKey relation is mapped ID wise, not fieldWise, 
So, to display the author name, you need to use ->  `{{user.author.name}}` , having said that, I would again recommend you to go through the resources properly please, this thing also is mentioned in them and documented properly in django's official documentation.

I'll try to look deeper into your project's code once I get some more time, but till then I would highly want you to improve your coding style also, 

For displaying data related to blogs, you've used names such as  `user.author` and `user.img` , they seem more likely to display data related to user, which is not the case and which even confused me while looking into your code, so please try to use appropriate variable names.

You did a great first attempt. The posters quite relates to the theme and overall vibe is good too. The poster is spacious too and have good overall balance.
Few things where you can work on-
1. Fonts- The font you used in bottom left read is difficult to read. Although it relates well to the theme but readability is the first thing you should consider while choosing a theme.
2. Colours- Colours are decent here but as you know gaming posters looks better if you use flouroscent colours instead. Neon effect would look great here. Colours of icons have less contrast, better use white colour.
3. Icons consistency- Use either line icons or filled icons in one poster, here you have used both.
4. Hierarchy- You need to improve heirarchy, by increasing the font of ""birthday party"".. Now fonts of ""You are invited to"" and ""Birthday party"" is same.",null,null,design,null,0,860,2022-05-17

Python
1- Variable
* Underscore represent output of previous operation
2- Loops
3-Function
4-Oops 
Classes and objects
Inheritance
5-Lists,tuples,sets and dictionary
Namedtuple () - returns tuple with a named value for each element in the tuple
Deque () - optimised list to perform insertion and deletion
Chainmap () - dictionary like class for creating single view of multiple mapping
Counter - dictionary subclass for counting same object
OrderedDict - dictionary subclass which remember the order in which entries were done
DefaultDict - dictionary subclass which calls a factory function to supply missing values
UserDict - wrapper around dictionary object for easier dictionary sub-classing
UserList - wrapper around list object for easier list sub-classing
UserString - wrapper around string object for easier list sub-classing

Solved two assignments of python
1- Basic assigning and changing values of list at certain indexes
2- input taking and checking various conditions using if else statement,list formation using for loop,etc
Solved one pandas assignment it was similar to the previous one.",null,null,finance,null,0,1124,2022-05-17

Your second iteration seems more monochromatic than first, which shows improvement. Use of minimum elements and colors add ease to viewer. Design should be comforting to the eyes of audience. It should use minimum effort to understand. 

1. Second iteration also has some scope of improvement like use of minimum vectors, make less variation in font type.

I had been inactive in the community for the past fortnight as I was focused on making the best out of my last days of dream college life. And I'm happy to tell you all that it in fact was worth it and completed the final piece which was remaining in my dream college life.

And yesterday I arrived at home and am now all set to slowly restart spending time in unleashing my passion and dreams together with the dreamers🔥.   I can see that the energy has multiplied exponentially in the community, so I can't wait to join this revolutionary energy.

Thanks a ton, dreamers for leading the community in my absence❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥 

And now I would like to share a couple of my observations after returning home:
1. The change in the dimensions of the physical objects in the house vs in the hostel, for eg: dining table, washbasin, room dimensions, etc. led to a weird sense of newness. These changes are instantly noticed by our minds and it just feels strange every time I think about this😬 
2. While having lunch at home, I had a habit of watching ''Tarak Mehta...'. So, yesterday when I fetched food from the kitchen and went ahead to have lunch, I went to switch on the TV without even thinking. Then suddenly I realized that it's a habit I have gotten used to. So, I thought about what I actually wanted to do in the situation and decided to talk to my grandmother instead of watching TV.
This event reflected the powerful effect habits have on us. So, beware of your habits...",null,"❤️‍🔥 (10),🔥 (1)",life-updates,null,11,1489,2022-05-18

Today, I attended a meeting withh design team of Curelink and after the meeting we were asked what did you learn from the meeting. I was sitting quitely and heard people telling the summary of the meeting. then it was my turn to answer and I said to them that i learned to be patient. when you have something in mind and you need to convey your thought ton people to get the desired output, it becomes crucial to listen to people , unnderstand their doubts and reply with a clear answer.

Here are some of my learnings from today:

- have great patience. everyone has got a different understanding and interpretation level.
- listen carefully and think about the input received.
- Have great clarity about your product. You must be able to convey requirements in simple language and have answers to maximum questions put up by the team.
- set the context. brief them about the scenario. you have a complete setup in your mind but the people you are explaining to have almost no idea.
- note down the questions you could not answer and look for their solutions. It is your duty to make them feel the expectations of the project.

A product till it gets ready is just a feeling and you have to ensure that it comes into existence.

7.74644E+17,utkarsh#1616,2022-05-19 01:28:00,"Hey @everyone
Just gone through a article regarding difference in **Neural Network and Our Brain.** Sounds interesting. right?
When a child is born, what does the child know? To our knowledge, the child knows only how to cry. When the child grows, the step by step learning process begins. First, the child learns to drink milk. Then the child learns to identify its parents. Every time a child learns something, it is encoded into some portion of the brain. Yet there is a difference in the way the information is stored in brain. Some information or instances are ""hard-coded"" within the brain. As a result, we never forget certain things. Some information is incompletely learned which will lose its strength and not be retained in our brain. 

Now let us compare this human activity with neural networks. Whenever *we create a new neural network, it is like giving birth to a child*. After birth, we start to train the network. When a child is born we do not know where the child will concentrate its studies through life. We leave it in the hands of the child and its parents. Naturally, parents play an extremely important role in child development and this is similar to the person creating a neural network. The way that child becomes an expert in an area, we train the neural networks to become expert in an area. Now the question remains, what is the difference between human and neural networks? Both can learn and become expert in an area and both are mortal. The main difference is, humans can forget but neural networks cannot. Once fully trained, a neural net will not forget. Whatever a neural network learns is hard-coded and becomes permanent.",null,null,data-and-analytics,null,0,1661,2022-05-19

Well these terms are self-explanatory though -> One of the reasons we switched from Vanilla JS to React is for introducing hierarchy in our application and managing different components in different files for our ease to write the code and now this hierarchy is somewhat like this ->

let us consider the code file for component1 -> 

```
export default function component1 () {
return (
  <Component2 />
);
}
```
so in this, I've imported and used component2 inside the DOM structure part of component1 -> which means component1 is parent of component2.

Example 2 -> 

In this code example ->

```
<div>
  <p>Some stuff</p>
<div>
```
Here, `<p>` acts as child for `<div>` .

I hope this would clear some sort of definitions of parent and child components for you.",null,null,software-development,null,0,799,2022-05-19

There's another reason to why I am restarting: This streak tracks how much I read.

```
function onSearchChange() {
  // write your piece of code here

Today I arrived at a possible reason as to why I wasn't planning my day for the past 10 days in college. 
It was because my major priority was spending time with friends, so the 'ambitious me' wasn't able to complete majority of tasks I had planned. So, I stopped planning my day🥺 

 I was unaware that my major priority was getting fulfilled, so I should not have been bothered by not being able to complete the other tasks.

This made me learn that I must write down my major priority for the day and not worry about how many other tasks I complete. 

So, if any of you is struggling to plan your day, just note down your major priority of the day and then playfully go about your day without worrying about how many other tasks you are able to complete 💪",null,🔥 (2),day-planning,null,2,768,2022-05-19

One thing that I noticed in a startup is the ownership you get in your work.
1. Everything coin has two sides of it, one can get complete ownership of the work and on the other hand you don't have any structures or an organized way to do that work.
I wanted to have the complete ownership of my work, so it has been something very good to me.
As a product manager intern I have been given 3 problem that needs to be solved and currently I am solving 1 of them.
My keen observation is that there are many factors that are contributing to the problems in some or other way in very little amount making a huge difference at end. 
2. So the problem that is to be solved is actually not the problem that is given to me.
3. Now something form the experience as a product manager it is more of a brainstorming job.
For one of the small problem I have to go after both designers as well as developers.
The designers and developers don't do your work until you make them realise the importance of the work.
Other than this you have to learn a lot of new stuff on the daily basis to get the work done. You can't stick to anyone technology for your work.

Interest rate :- Return obtained from investment without risk. They act as benchmark to make an investment about other possible investment.
Ex - pure discount bonds
Simple and compound interest:- Practically interest is compound
Important : Frequency of interest paid by bank can be weekly/monthly/quarterly/semi-annually/annually.
Q-) When interest rate are paid out with different frequencies then how does one compare the return?
A -) Transform rates into common rates typically 1 year, known as Annualised interest rate.
Continuous interest rate:- nominal rate paid continuously .
Present value :- An important concept to make choices between two future payments.
Q-) How to transform future payments into value today.
Today's worth of future payments is called Present value.
Present and future values of cash flows :- extrnd to series of payment or cash flows.
Bond yield :- interest rate analysis+ present value analysis
What is yield :- Defined as interest rate value for which present value of bonds payment is equal to bond price.
Price yield curve :- A price yield curve is a graph where we plot price on y axis against yield of bond.
Spot rate :- Annualised nominal interest rate of pure discount bonds.",null,null,finance,null,0,1247,2022-05-20

Attaching the image, since most of you might not know his name but recognise him with his face. 
Also, he was meant to visit at 5 a.m. and leave before 11 a.m. which was the time I slept, but his visit was rescheduled to visit at 11 a.m. - 4 p.m. so it was like nature created the conditions as I was meant to meet him today. 😄😄

From the day I joined,both the quality and quantity projects that the team can hand over to me have increased. A few things you can learn while working in a team are-
1. Always try to improve your way of working but never change it according to someone else just because he does it that way. 
2. Always try to be active in the team( specifically in your domain but a little active with other domains too). Helps in better communication within the team. 
3. Get the ownership of your own project/work. Never trust anybody with it. Never fear to implement your ideas to make it better. Try to do everything in your power to get the work done in the best way. Makes you the happiest ( Personal suggestion). 

Specifically speaking as a product design Intern, above points have helped me to be better at work.

Things you can work on-
1. Again Fonts could be improved. It does not seem minimalistic now. It's better to use one simple font.
Tip1- Use fonts.google.com to browse great fonts.
Tip2- You can download WhatFont chrome extension to know font of any website you like.
2. Gradients- Gradient you put in stars could be improved. Black does not complement on blue. Also gradient of background can be improved. May be you can try picking one more colour and mixing it with blue

Then I came to my room and had a nap which turned out to be two hour long sleep and just as I woke up I got call about my TT match (we're having intra bhawan sports tournament) kept my racket in room and went to mess when I met Satyam sir and heard how they were motivating other students to follow their passion. I loved their analogy of time that people look at the skill in which minimum work is required (which they mentioned as distance) but people forget about the speed (that is if it drives them). After having dinner I was hanging out with my friends when I other friend called me to ask if I was willing to play TT with him as he had TT match later and I'm really glad I said yes.

There are Mainly two types of Leader 
1.Public Leaders
2.Personal Leaders.

Public leaders are Those who influence people only by their Position, by their speeches, by their Health and Wealth.
Example: Hitler

But Public leader is One who actually inspires others by his/her work, Actions , Character, Thoughts.
Example: Swami Vivekananda, APJ Abdul Kalam, Nelson Mandela.

The learning curve for me has been quite fast for the past few weeks had to adjust to the fast paced life of bangalore and slow paced life of Corporates.
Today got to meet one of my best friends and a senior from college and discussed about various stuff ranging from passion entrepreneurship to finally college life .
It was a great experience.
From now on I am going to be accountable to every activity I do and will post here so as to go back and reflect on myself.
I felt I had lost a bit of direction after coming here as all these big buildings and offices were completely new to a tier 3 city kid like me who has always idolised Warren Buffet,played in the rawest form on streets.
Tough to act composed and normal in such an environment but after some time I got used to it the bar raised and I'm constantly raising it for myself.

I have taken some decisions to change my current routine
1)Get on Meditation regularly no skipping.
2)Start updating my regular stuff and day planning on Explorin community
3)Live the way I like unafraid and naturally.
4)Most important - Talk to people.

Hopefully life will steer me towards the right directions and even if I fail would still keep the enthu to learn and try again.",null,🔥 (6),daily-experiences,null,6,1238,2022-05-22

under the section of PSYCHOPATHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY THINGS, I gone through some learnings:
Stylish and attractive designs can win a prize of Design, but remember; the two most important characteristics of good design are discoverability and understanding. DISCOVERBILITY: Figuring out what actions are possible and how to perform it. UNDERSTANDING: What does it all mean…What are the controls? Now, for simple devices design should not contain unnecessary elements for making the user understand the product while for complex devices, extras (manuals) are needed.
Designs need to be made with an assumption that people will make error! 
HUMAN-CENTERED DESIGN: It is an approach in which we make designs that puts human needs, capabilities and behaviour first! 
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF INTREACTION: Interaction with the good product design can result in pleasurable experiences. Experience is critical feeling, it’s not just about liking something, in fact it is the answer to the question that how fondly people remember their interactions. Cognition and emotion both play an important role for good experience.",null,"❤️‍🔥 (2),💯 (1)",writing,null,3,1171,2022-05-23

1. Generating Revenue from a startup /company is the most important and crucial thing. Most startups fails because they are failed to generate revenue.

2.  Selling is the most important skill that a Founder must know.  Having best Product or service is good but it is marketing that  let you sell your product/ service and make your business profitable.

3.      4 % rule :  This is most important thing that anyone can use to enhance thier productivity.  Basically it cames after applying Pareto rule (20/80 principle) twice.
A businessman should only focus on the top 4% tasks that let him generate the revenue and it will be 64% of total revenue. 96% of the tasks are still needs to be done but that should be delegated or outsourced. 
Exact sentence is : ""Only 4% of your activities each day drive your business forward and move
the money needle. The other 96% of the things still have to get done, but they
shouldn’t get done by you.""

Retailers (people like you and I) started buying houses on loans. These loans were provided by local banks like ICICI or HDFC. Once these local banks gathered sufficient pool of retail clients, they clubbed them to form a portfolio and sold it to bigger bulge bracket clients something like Morgan Stanley or GS in exchange of cash right away after discounting some value.

Now, these local banks started aggressively pushing out loans to people with lower cibil ratings or poor credit profiles because the risk was not on their head. Ultimately, it was the bulge bracket which was taking the risk. So loans were given without doing proper due diligence (these are also called subprime loans), and then HDFC or similar kind sold off portfolio to bulge brackets. Finally, these poor credit profile retailers started defaulting on loans, affecting not just the housing prices but also resulting in higher NPAs for bulge brackets.",null,❤️ (1),finance,null,1,1053,2022-05-24

*Regression analysis attempt to measure the relationship between dependent and one or more independent variables.
* Scatter plot is a collection of points on graph where each point represent value of two variables
* A population regression line indicates expected value of dependent variables conditional one or more independent variables
* Difference between actual dependent variable and given expected value is error term 
* b1= Cov(X,Y)/VAR(X).  Bo = Y° - b1X°
* Assumptions made with simple linear regression
a . Expected value of error term, conditional on independent variables,is zero.
b . All (X,Y) observation are independent and identically distributed.
c . It is unlikely that large outliers will be observed.
* OLS estimator are both unbiased and consistent
ESS:- measures the variation in dependent variable that is explained by independent variables
TSS:- measure total variation in dependent variable.
SSR :- measure the unexplained variation in dependent variable.
Coefficient of determination is measure of"" goodness of fit"" of regression.",null,null,finance,null,0,1089,2022-05-25

P value is smallest level of significance for which null hypothesis can be rejected
t test with n-2 degree of freedom

Y° = Bo + b1X

Effects of heteroscedasticity
* Stardard error usually are unreliable estimate
* Coefficient estimate aren't perfect
* If standard error are too small, but coefficient estimate are not affected,t statistics are too large

What is derivate
* Derivative is financial security with value that is derived from an underlying asset
Derivatives:- 
1- Futures
2- Option
Forward (risk associated):- 
Counterparty risk
Liquidity risk
Solution of these risks is in future
Future:- 
Underlying: what you are holding
Lot size: minimum quantity you trade
Contract size : number of shares*price
Expiry: In Equities last Thursday
Margin: need to deposit
Margins prevent risk of default
Leverage = contract value/ margin
Future is ""Zero Sum Game""
Payoff in future is linear
Settlement : closing price on expiry date
Cash settlement and physical settlement
Open interest : can increase or decrease.
Volume always increase
Circuit :- if price Change by 10% coding off period begin ( trade is paused for 15 mins) another 5% change and for another 15 mins trade pauses.
Shorting: sell first and buyback if price drops
Option Greeks 
1- delta
2- gamma
3- Vega
4- theta
Delta :- rate of change in premium wrt underlying
Gamma :- rate of change of delta/ rate of change of underlying.Also called curvature of option
Theta :- far time from expiry, premium increase
Always favour seller. Premium = Time value + Intrinsic value",null,🔥 (2),finance,null,2,1206,2022-05-25

This is the first iteration of the replica of Razorpay Website. It is incomplete for now. It took a lot of time. But I learned a lot about figma though having many doubts.

1. I first made black and white wireframe as suggested in the goal. When I started to add colors, it became so tedious as I color almost every part separately. So how to make layers more systematically to avoid it.
2. Is there any way to replace color of similar text of illustration at the same time.
3. There is an automatic vertical scrolling in the website, how to do it in prototype and any material to learn prototype properly.
4. The boxes that are clickable pop up on hovering on them. I am having trouble in making them too.
5. I wasn't able to find the exact font of website. How can I do that.
6. Any practice to make curves better in the pen tool.
7. Some colors on website are not 100% opaque. How to pick those colors as color picker show the hex of resultant color visible.

Volatility :- swings
* Frequency and severity with which the market price of an investment fluctuate. More market swing means more volatility.
Implied volatility
* Represent how volatile the stock will be in near future. IV increase so making big move of underlying
Put IV is greater than call IV
On the money (faraway) : IV increase a lot
IV rank :(Today IV -low)/(high-low)*100
IV percentile : what% of days the IV was low in last 1 year.
Historical volatility: 
Looks at past events
Implied volatility:
Predict future volatility
IV tends to overstate the actual expected move nearly every stock in long term.
Options are overpriced because of volatility and if market do not fluctuate that much sellers make a lot of money.

To Hedge Right

Let's have an intuitive understanding,
Let's assume we bought a stock expecting the price to go up
Hedgers use options to protect their assets from adverse price movements right( In our case price moving downwards ), and when the perception of risk increases, so makes the demand for this protection.
In this context, risk means volatility—the potential for more significant moves to the downside (In our case). 
The relative prices of options are driven higher by increased demand for protective options when the market anticipates greater volatility.",null,null,finance,null,0,608,2022-05-27

Myself ***Tarun***, Junior Mentor - Finance @ Explorin Institute of Dreamers
I'm currently pursuing my Dream Internship at **KIFS Trade Capital Mumbai** as **Quant Trading Intern**

I was sitting at the Volatility Trading Desk 💲
My desk was surrounded by Traders 👨‍💻
It was a dream come true for me because I am experiencing the real essence of a life of traders, and how to control emotions in black swan events                                                                                                        **My Learning:** People not only trade price, but they also do trade volatility

The best thing about this firm is, that there is no bias based on hierarchy or something like that, we can directly go to the desk of senior-level traders to shoot our doubts, even the head of departments are sitting along with us, there are no such separate cabins for them
They believe in Transparency, At the EOD everyone sits and discusses their strategies and learning of the day, and plans for tomorrow

Timings: 9:00 AM to 4:30 PM

From the Day-01 itself, they had allotted me a desk besides senior traders
Currently, my project is IV calculation using Newton Raphson Algorithm and Intraday Short Stangle - BNF weekly options

They have 3 floors
One floor of Prop Desk, Trading Stock Options
One floor of Prop Desk, Trading Index Options
Other is my dream desk, High-Frequency Trading

After a week of experience at the Stock Options Trading Desk, Today I'll be shifting to Index Trading Desk
My Dream is to Make it to the moon i.e HFT Desk soon 🔥

Hope you guys also having great learning and experience in your Internships 💙🌠",null,"🔥 (11),🤩 (5)",internship-experiences,null,16,1646,2022-05-27

I could see a lot of work done on the poster.🔥  Have some suggestions tho-
1. Minimalistic Design- There are a lot of graphic elements down there.. you can try removing some of them till it look clean.
2. Redundancy- I can see Happy Birthday written twice, and birthday written even thrice. So you need to remove the redundancy, since it writing it twice does not make it any better.
3. Text Formatting- Date, time, address and information below it is not formatted. You can prioritize the important information and then use different font sizes and weights to format it. No expensive gifts and just follow the dress code are two separate informations, written on same level, these could be separated as well.

**Doubt regarding data fetching in DS_3 Goal 1.**

It says you have to fetch the data of top 100 companies according to market capitalization. 

Steps to do that: 
**step 1** Refer to tbe library i.e. nsepy which gives you the open, close, high low price,etc of any given company.  The catch is you have to pass the symbol of that company and the duration between which you want the data.


**step 2** Search for a excel file which consists the name and symbol of top 100 companies, you will get it on internet. 


**step 3** Define a function which loop through the symbol column of the excel file.


**step 4** Take one of the column of each company, for ex close price and construct the dataframe having dates in row and column as close price of 100 companies.  


**step 5** Attach last column for sensex data. And hurray your dataset is ready for next process.


If you are still stuck somewhere please let me know.

Volatility
1-Expected volatility
2- Implied volatility
3- historical volatility
HV : 
HV is a measure of how volatile the price movement of a security has been
during a certain period of time.
Expressed in terms of standard deviations.
IV : 
IV is a measure of how volatile the stock will be in future.
IV depends on supply and demand in market.
HV-IV Divergence
An HV-IV divergence occurs when HV declines and IV rises or vice versa.
Expected stock volatility:
Yearly standard deviations can be related to that

 of one day or one week by dividing the standard

 deviations for 1 year by sqrt of number of

 trading days that year to calculate for one day

 and multiply number of trading days sqrt to

 calculate for 1 month.

Yesterday, My day at the office was amazing ✨

After my First project review, I had shifted to the Index Trading Desk, where almost everyone was 15-20 Years of Experience in Market

So My desk was in between my manager and senior trader, Aftermarket closed at around 4 PM no one was there except my manager on that floor
I was noting the IVs of EOD for Nifty and Bank Nifty, Then my manager, I mean he is also a senior trader who was a pioneer in Skew Trading, came to me and reviewed my progress
Then I started to ask questions to him, He was explaining each and every minute detail with practical examples
I was wondering that the discussion went for 2.5 Hrs, Literally 2.5 Hrs a manager spending time with an Intern just to Ignite me with his knowledge was amazing 💙
Post that he discussed
- The scope of trading, 
- How a typical trading firm functions 💲
- What's the growth curve of a trader 🌠
- A day in a Life of a Trader 👨‍💻
- Strategies they are using (Typically they use only 5 Strategies with 5 different cases for each strategy): Key Learning we can take is, We don't need complex models to make money in markets, all we need is simple strategies with consistent performance and especially emotional control 
- How to be stable in every situation and emotional controlling 🙌 e.t.c

Has anyone made anger as one's strength?

Since last 3-4 days I am having loads of anger issues. I don't know one time everything seems good the next second I got triggered and get angry like a hell. I am unable to figure out what is the trigger point. There are lot of fuzzy thoughts going on in my mind and I am unable to untangle it. Tried meditation but the thoughts become too intense and I became impatient. 

Yesterday after sharing this fuzziness with some people I felt light but those events are still provoking my anger evertime I am thinking of it.

As you mentioned meditation and all... keep in mind they won't work like your code in vs code that you just need to press run button it takes time.
If you want short term relief from anger just be with the community you love to be with or talk to those who really care for you and want to really know what you are feeling inspite or just listening and ignoring.

1. You can try to blend the background gradients, use less colors (you can browse about 60-30-10 color rule, it will give you a rough idea of how to play with minimum colors).
2. Spacing between fonts is not proper...try to put group of fonts closer which deliever same set of information.
3. You can reduce the number of vector for more subtle look or if you want to keep them, try to use blending colors(these colors can either blend with background or with your font color).
4. You can also use regular, semi bold or bold types to reflect hierarchy with same font type.",null,null,design,null,0,652,2022-05-28

TSHIRT_1. Logo is conering a large area...it's size should be in proportion with font since the logo represents the font. It should not be considered as a different element.
TSHIRT_2. Try to fill same colors to font which reflect one idea so that eye reads them collectively.
TSHIRT_2 AND 3: Here, I can clearly see that 3rd one is more appealing. Browse about primary colors, secondary colors and neutral colors, you'll get an idea that why yellow is more highlighting than white on the font EXPLORIN(plus yellow is the secondary color of brand, so you should try to fill explorin with yellow).
TSHIRT_4. I liked that idea of putting brand colors to their tshirts. Yellow is bright color, it is filled in a major proportion which is imbalancing visual balance.
Other than that, I would like to ask you that why have you put the word DREAMERS in the white box?",null,null,design,null,0,945,2022-05-28

Option greeks
Factor that impact option price
1- Type of option
2- Underlying price
3-Time to expiration
4- Strike price
5- Volatility
6- Interest rate
7- Dividend (if paid)
Important points
* Long call and short put will benefit when underlying price rises and vice-versa
* Short call and long put will benefit when underlying price fall and vice-versa
* Increase in underlying price benefit call option buyer and decrease in same benefits holder of put option
* Moneyness= strike price- underlying price
* Strike price is below underlying price for call option it is ITM
* Higher time to expiration higher will be probability of option moving in favour of buyer
* Rise in interest rate benefits value of call and hurt put option
* Delta is probability of option expiring in the money
* Higher delta means high risk
*ITM  delta is inversely proportional to volatility.opposite for OTM
* Gamma measure change in directional risk
* Gamma will be high when strike price-stock price at T will be 0.
* Person buys option,gamma is positive
* Person sell option,gamma is negative
* Buyer of both call and put will benefit when IV go up and lose when IV go down.
* Vega is positive for long and negative for short option
* Vega is identical for both put and call
* Vega impacts only time value not intrinsic value
* Higher the time to expiration,higher would be vega or equal
* Vega highest for ATM 
* When moving towards ITM or OTM vega declines.",null,null,finance,null,0,1471,2022-05-28

-> You have mentioned multiple times that the company is performing better than its peers in terms of ratios. But there are no numbers that I see. Neither Cipla’s ratios, nor the peers that you have selected along with ratios.

-> Latest trend in the sector is okay, but how is it beneficial for Cipla is not mentioned. What is the current market share of Cipla? Which products or category does it cater do? How are those categories going to grow? Who are the peers in this category?

-> Shareholding pattern: No comments

-> Key Ratios: Same remarks as first point

Overall there are a lot more things that I’d want you to add. Basic information on the company, what it does, what products it has. Information on its existing financials (basic financials not the ratios). Talk about the competitive landscape. Talk about what are the growth plans for Cipla based on its press releases. In next 5 years what is the target? Then talk about key ratios and conclude it",null,null,finance,null,0,998,2022-05-29

Delta 
* How moneyness impact it
* How time impacts it
* How volatility impacts it
* Delta is rate of change in price of an option for every 1 point move in price of underlying.
* Delta of call option is (0-1).
* Delta of put option is (-1,0).
* New option price = Old option price + Delta*(new underlying price - old underlying price).
* Delta represent the probability of option expiring ITM.
* ITM call delta ranges from 0.5 to 1 .
* ATM call delta is 0.5 .
* OTM call delta ranges from 0 to 0.5 .
* ITM put delta ranges from -0.5 to -1 .
* ATM put delta is -0.5  .
* OTM put delta ranges from -1 to -0.5 .
* Delta of underlying is 1.
* Option having higher delta are more responsive to change in price of underlying.
* For ITM ,delta of an option closer to expiry is higher and vice-versa.
* For OTM ,delta of an option closer to expiry is lower and vice-versa.
* For ATM ,delta of an option closer to expiry is lower and vice-versa.
* For ITM ,delta of an option higher if low volatility and vice-versa.
* For OTM ,delta of an option higher means high volatility.
* Value of delta keeps changing as other variables do 
* Important : call delta + put delta = 1.",null,🔥 (3),finance,null,3,1187,2022-05-29

Here are my learnings...

1. I learned about decision trees and how to make predictions using these trees, I found it very useful if you know how to ask optimal questions to classify things.
2. I also learned about ensembling methods.. and It shows how from many small decision trees or models we can create our own ensembled model with better predictions. It is the thing that takes most of my time in the goal but at the same time returns the most too.
3. Then I learned different types of ensembling models made on decision trees like AdaBoost, LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, and GradientBoost. 

After learning this stuff when I faced the real-world scenario given in the problem statement, first I was not able to get how I will use these things in the problem... eventually reading notebooks and getting the idea make things more clear to me and finally I did what is needed in the problem. Overall it was a nice experience for me to work on this problem and I learned much from this.

Thanks to @utkarsh for helping me out in many places..",null,❤️‍🔥 (4),data-and-analytics,null,4,1185,2022-05-30

Gamma
* How it impacts delta, how moneyness impact it.
* How time to expiration and volatility impacts it.
* Gamma is rate of change of delta for every 1 point move in price of underlying.
* Delta measures directional risk and gamma measure change in directional risk.
* Rising gamma mean any change in price of underlying would be greater change in delta, which leads to greater change in option price.
* At ATM gamma is highest. When move towards ITM or OTM gamma reduces.
* Deep ITM or OTM gamma is 0.
* Gamma for buyer is positive while for seller is negative.
* Gamma causes delta of long option to move 0 when call option underlying price decrease or rises for put
* Seller wants underlying to be stable.  *Gamma variation with time to expiration
                  
ITM.                        Short time.          Higher

ATM.                       Short time           Increase
                               Long time.         Decrease

* Gamma of ITM or OTM reduce when time to expiration is near.
* Deep ITM or OTM gamma falls for short time to expire and vice-versa.
* Gamma of ATM increase as time in expiration near.
* Gamma high for ATM with low volatility and it starts reducing as volatility increase.
* As volatility increase, gamma of ITM and OTM reduce.
* When deep OTM or ITM , increase in volatility cause gamma to be higher.
* Gamma curve tends to be sensitive to price change in low volatility than to price change in high volatility.
* Signs of delta and gamma

1. Colours- You can try other colours. Red colour is generally used in danger signs or warning, so may be it's not a good match with party vibe.
2. Fonts- Right now you have used a single font, you can try using two fonts. The other one could be a script font.
3. Font Size- Font sizes are bigger than average here. You can try reducing them for better font formatting.

Theta
* Theta measure impact of time on price of option.
* Theta is defined as change in option price for a one unit change in time left to expiration.
* Theta is defined as lost of option value as a result of time decay.
* Time decay is the rate at which the value of an option erodes with each passing day.
* Theta works in favour of option writer and against option buyer
* Theta is negative for long position and positive for short position.
* Price of an option reduces each day by theta.
* Call value erode slightly Higher than put.
* ATM 
* has highest theta
* Theta increase in absolute value with passing days , before starting to rise exponentially as expiration gets closer.
* ATM is risky because of rapid declining theta will rapidly erode time value of option.
* ITM
* Intrinsic value form larger component
* Have low theta , deep ITM have low loss in terms of time value.
* Theta tends to increase at slower rate, before starting to fall sharply as expiry gets closer 
* OTM 
* Have only time value no intrinsic value
* Deep OTM , lower time value lower theta
* Theta increase at slower rate before exponential decrease
* Higher volatility, higher time value of an option , higher option value.
* Fall in time value of option with high volatility tends to be greater than fall in time value option with low volatility.
* Low volatility, fall in time value is steadier.",null,null,finance,null,0,1414,2022-05-31

* Volatility is rate at which price of an asset fluctuate over time.
* Historical volatility measures the dispersion around mean for daily returns on an Annualised basis.
* Implied volatility is measure of future volatility.
* Vega is defined as change in option price for every 1% change in implied volatility.
* Higher the IV higher would be change in option price.
* Buyer of a call or put benefit when IV go up.
* Seller of a call or put benefit when IV go down.
* Vega is positive for long position and negative for short position.
* Long means you have long vega exposure and short means you have short vega exposure.
* Rising volatility works against option seller.
* Vega is identical for all call and put.
* Vega impacts only time value component of option price that is extrinsic value not the Intrinsic value.
* Higher time to expiration, higher would be vega
* Vega is highest for ATM.
* As moving either ITM or OTM vega starts declining
* Vega is too low for deep ITM and OTM.
* Maximum impact of change in IV tends to occur for options that are ATM because they tend to have highest vega.
* Closer the probability of option expiring ITM moves towards extreme lower will be vega",null,"❤️‍🔥 (3),🔥 (1)",finance,null,4,1230,2022-06-01

Black scholes model
* It is differential equation widely used to price option contract.
* It requires 5 input variables, strike price of an option, current stock price, Time to expiration, risk free rate and volatility.
* Due to certain assumptions price deviate from real world results.
* Only used in European option as it doesn't take into account that American option can be exercised before time to expiration.
* BSM posits that instrument, such as stock shares or future contact, will have lognormal distribution of prices following a random walk with constant drift and Volatility.
* It is theoretically possible for option seller to set rational prices for the option that they are selling.
* Model predicts that the price of heavily traded asset follow a geometric browninan motion with constant Volatility and drift.
Assumptions :- 
* No dividend are paid out during the life of an option.
* Markets are random
* There are no transactions costs in buying an option.
* Risk free rate and volatility of the underlying asset are known and constant
* Returns on the underlying asset are log- normally distributed
* Option is European and can be only exercise at expiration.
Volatility skew :- 
* BSM assume stock price follow lognormal distribution because asset prices cannot be negative.
* Asset prices are observed to have significant right skewness and some degree of kutosis. This means high risk Downward moves often happens in market than normal distribution.
Drawback :-
* Used for only European call and do not consider American option can be exercised before expiration.
* Assume dividend and risk free rate are constant, but this may not be true in reality.
* Model also assume volatility remain constant over option life.",null,🔥 (2),finance,null,2,1767,2022-06-02

Have you heard of **DALL-E 2** ?
Its a new creation from AI research group ***OpenAI(co-founded by Elon Musk)***
**A text to image generation program** that can create realistic images and art from a description in natural language.
> DALL·E 2 can create original, realistic images and art from a
> text description. It can combine concepts, attributes, and styles.

> It can make realistic edits to existing images from a natural language caption. It can add and remove elements while taking shadows, reflections, and textures into account.

> It can take an image and create different
> variations of it inspired by the original.

`It has learned the relationship between images and the text used to describe them. It uses a process called “diffusion,” which starts with a pattern of random dots and gradually alters that pattern towards an image when it recognizes specific aspects of that image.`

> The dog image was generated from the description “A Shiba Inu dog wearing a beret and black turtleneck”

Seems interesting ?

A good read on habit building
Primary learnings for me:
1. Be crystal clear about why you want to form that specific habit. This would give you the motivation to follow it consistently.

2. When you build a habit, aim to build a new identity.

Example: Don’t just try to run 5 km – instead, become a runner.

Sometime it is good to take a pause,
Look at your past and analyse the cause

Sometime it is good to take a break,
But remember doing it before every bone of your body gets cracked.

Delta :- 
* Delta is rate of change in price of an option for every 1 point move in price of underlying.
* Call option : (0,1) Put option : (-1,0)
* Delta represent the probability of an option expiring in ITM
* Call ITM : 0.5-1    ATM : 0.5      OTM : 0 to 0.5
* Put ITM : (-0.5,-1).  ATM : -0.5.   OTM : 0 to -0.5
* Delta of underlying is 1
* For OTM , delta of option close to expiry are lower 
*  For ITM , delta of option close to expiry are higher
* For ATM , delta of option close to expiry are lower
* For OTM and ITM delta lower if underlying has  low and high volatility respectively.
* Call delta + put delta = 1
* Delta measures directional risk
* Gamma 
* Gamma is rate of change of delta for every 1 point move in underlying price
* Gamma is highest for ATM
* When move towards ITM or OTM gamma reduces
* Deep ITM or deep OTM gamma is 0.
* Buyer : gamma (+ve), seller : gamma (-ve)
* ITM , short time to expiration, gamma higher than long time
* ATM - OTM , short time , gamma higher than long time
* ATM , short time , gamma higher than long time
* Gamma is high for ATM with low volatility and it starts reducing as volatility increase
* With increasing volatility gamma of ITM and OTM reduce
* For ITM or OTM, as time to expiration reduce gamma reduces
* Theta
* Change in option price for a one unit change in time left to expiration
* Theta works in favour of option seller and against buyers
* Negative for long call and long put
* Call value erode slightly Higher rate than put.
* ATM has highest theta
* ITM, intrinsic value form larger component of option price
* OTM have only time value
* Higher the volatility, higher will be theta",null,null,finance,null,0,1672,2022-06-04

* Change in option price for a one percent change in IV
* Vega is positive for long position
* Long means having long vega exposure
* Vega is identical for call and put
* Vega impacts only time value component of option price
* Higher time to expiration, higher would be vega
* Vega highest for ATM
* Maximum impact of change in IV tends to occur for options that are ATM because they tend to have highest vega",null,🔥 (2),finance,null,2,417,2022-06-04

Actually while you are somewhere , you just cant live anywhere else(unless you are a ghost 😂 ) and thinking about something else while doing any other task is not a problem, actually it is our mental capability that we humans have achieved from evolution of million years. The main thing is, when do we need to apply that capability ,and here comes meditation which helps us to be aware of what thoughts are coming in our mind. So just by being aware of our thoughts ,we can eliminate this problem of unconsciously being ""not in the moment"".  - this are some of the molded words from a video of Sadhguru I saw.

Back with another AI Creation.
How would you feel if you just pass question to the machine and it will **code for you**?
**So what does this mean for programming? Does it mean that there is no point in learning programming because it will get fully automated?**

We don't believe so. Here is what we think the impact will be:

> We'll have tools that help us code faster. We'll see more sophisticated code generation and refactor tools, and repetitive coding tasks -- the moments you see yourself copy-pasting code -- might get automated away wholly.
> 
> AI will make it easier to learn programming (and many other things). Imagine Codecademy-like courses entirely guided by AI with conversational abilities.
> 
> Eventually, AI will influence how we design programming languages, and a new class of languages will emerge. Since computers will be better and faster than humans at generating code, the act of programming itself might change. Who knows, we might be able to program by talking or even by moving in VR/AR.

At some point -- probably not in the near future -- `the word ""coding"" will disappear `from our lexicon because programming will stop requiring code and instead be about the pure act of solving problems using computers making it accessible to more and more people.

In the meantime, if you haven't yet, you should still learn how to code and get good at it. It's unlikely that things will change meaningfully in the short-term, and coding is still the best way to program computers. But keep your eyes open to the future, as many AI groups like Repl.it is building the most advanced programming environment regardless of the modality.

Types of mutual funds
* Equity fund :- this sort of fund invests principally in stocks. Within this group are various subcategories.
* Fixed income fund :- focuses on investments that pay a set rate of return, such as government bonds, corporate bonds, or other debt instruments
* Index fund :- investment strategy is based on the belief that it is very hard, and often expensive, to try to beat the market consistently.
* Balanced fund :- Balanced funds invest in a hybrid of asset classes, whether stocks, bonds, money market instruments, or alternative investments. The objective is to reduce the risk of exposure across asset classes.
* Money market fund :- consists of safe , short-term debt instruments, mostly government treasury bills.
* Income funds :- These funds invest primarily in government and high-quality corporate debt, holding these bonds until maturity in order to provide interest streams.
* International funds :- invests only in assets located outside your home country.
* Speciality fund :- consists of funds that have proved to be popular but don't necessarily belong to the more rigid categories.
* Regional fund :- make it easier to focus on a specific geographic area of the world.
* Socially responsible fund :- invest only in companies that meet the criteria of certain guidelines or beliefs.
* Exchange traded fund :- they are structured as investment trusts that are traded on stock exchanges and have the added benefits of the features of stocks.",null,"🔥 (3),💯 (1)",finance,null,4,1507,2022-06-05

7.47722E+17,Divyansh#4279,2022-06-06 01:42:00,"Not feeling good as was unable to make up for a commitment made. After self-assessment realised that this bad feeling was not because the commitment was not completed but because I was unable to provide even a single second. If I had given it some time, I know it would have resulted in something fruitful. And this thought of zero effort is what has disappointed me. 

Realisation-: Efforts should be made as it results in growth (high or low) and that growth serves as a fuel (hope of improving) for the coming day. 
However, no efforts = no growth = self-defeating thoughts = weak and detained mind = no effort and you get stuck in this loop.

Also, will make sure tomorrow doesn't result in self-disappointment. 

Another thought -: Self-assessment or self-awareness is something that should be used as a very precious tool as it has the power to convert your bad & disappointing thoughts into good & motivating ones. Just by assessing the situation, everything gets organised and so do your thoughts, they reach the place they should always be - ""THE SHELVES OF POSITIVITY""",null,❤️ (4),daily-experiences,null,4,1078,2022-06-06

Found this blog very interesting. I strongly suggest those interested in being PMs at early-stage startups to give it 2 minutes. @anuj @Mohit @sourabkumar004 @Khush @vedant11 @argus @Aman Vishwakarma 

Two learnings stood out for me:
1. The thing that product people often fail to appreciate is how hard it is to go from an idea to having even a couple hundred thousand dollars of revenue. It’s a skillset that product people rarely have themselves.
That empathy ultimately enables you to have conversations with the founders around pivoting and adapting existing product strategies to help prepare for the next stage of growth and make the company successful. But that level of respect and understanding must always be brought with you; otherwise, you’re just going to set yourself up to fail.

2. **An often-overlooked aspect of early-stage product management is that different PMs come in and add value at certain stages:**

**You want to have the openness to serve for as long as you’re useful and recognize that there’s nothing wrong with moving on to the next thing and passing the baton to someone else to take the company to the next level.**",null,❤️ (1),product-management,null,1,1247,2022-06-06
